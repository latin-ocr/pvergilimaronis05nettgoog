’ xliv AENEIS.

ments remain,¹ or tc inquire whether the Aeneidis likely to have
benefited by the example of Hostius’ work, De Bello Histrico, iu any
other respect than iu the multiplicatiou oi the ‘⁴ ten tongues '’ oi the
second Iliad into a hundred.¹ As little necessity is there to spealr of
the possible effect cf Roman tragedy on the Aeneid‚ as, though there
are evident procis that Virgil did not disdain to imitate individual
passagea' his real obligations are not to Ennius, Pacuvius, or Attius,
but to the great Athenian masters whom they copied as Ennius
copied Homer.

'I'he result of our inquiry then is this. Virgil imitated Homer, bnt
imitated him as a rival, not as adisciple; his object was not to give
a faithful interpretation oi his great master, but to draw forth his
own genius and satisfy the again which he lived 3 aud accordingly he
modified the Homeric story at his pleasure, according to the thousand
consideratione that might occur to a poetical artist, a pat1i0t‚anda
conuoisseur ci antiquarian learning. Of later influenceu the only one
which seems to have taken a really powerinl hold of him is Greek
tragedy‚ which was in fact the only instance oi a genius and culture
commensurate with his own, operatiug in a sphera analogous to his.
The epics of Alexandria and of early Rome may inrnish occasional
illustratione tc the commentator on the Aeneid3 but his more con·
tinuons studies will bo better devoted to the poetry of Homer and to
the magio drama of Graece.

¹ Seneca (Gontmv. 16, p. 299) says that Julius Montanus praised Virgil tor·
having improved (iu his description oi night, A. 8. 27, foll.) cn two lines oi
Varro: ’

“Desierant latrare canes, urbesque silebant:
Omnia noctis erant, placida composta qniete.’'

virgil, however, isuot neamu- to Varro than he is to Varrc's original, Apoll. 3. 749,
toll.

¹ “Homeri eat ote· ci μοι δέκα μὲν γλόσσαι, δέκα δὲ στόματ’ εἷεν. Hune secutus
Hostius poeta iu libro secundo Belli Histrici ait: Non si mihi linguae Centum
atque orasient totidem vocesque liquatae. Hinc Vergilius ait: Non mihi si linguae
centum sint oraque centum.’' Macrcb. Sat. 2. 3. It is worth uoting that Pope,
proteseing to damiate Homer, has turned the ten tongues into a thousand. He
had, however, some provocatiou, aa Ogilby had made them a hundred.
