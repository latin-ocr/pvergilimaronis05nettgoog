Ρ. VERGILI MARONIS

Accipere? aut quid iam misero mihi denique restat, 70
cui neque apud Danaos usquam locus, et super ipsi
Dardanidae infensi poenas cum sanguine poscunt?

Quo gemitu conversi animi, compressus et omnis
Impetus, Hortamur fari3 quo sanguine cretus,

Quidve ferat, memoret, quae sit fiducia capt0.

-Η, Ν.]. Ribbeck’s “quive fuat, memores
quae⁹⁹ &c. is another of his unhappy
conjectures. Much more ingenious is
another suggestion by an unnamed young
scholar, mentioned in his 11016. that a line
should be supplied from the parallel
passage in Book 3, “ quidve ferat. Pri·
amus rex ipse haud multa moratus Dat
iuveni dextram, quae sit fiducia capto.”
‘Memorem’ is another reading men-
tioned by Serv.; but with it not much
sense could be extracted from ‘⁸ quae sit
fiducia capto.” .

76.] This line is repeated 3. 612, while
here it is omitted in Med. (where it 18
added b another hand in 1116 margin),
Pal„ an Gud„ and 1101 noticed by Serv.
Heyne infers from Pomponius Sabinus
that it was erased on critical grounds by
Apronianus, whose recension Med. repre-
sents. Rom. unfortunately fails us here,
having an extensive lacuna after v. 72,
down to 3. 684. It is certain that Virg.
frequently repeats himself (probably with
the notion of imitating Hom. ), and equally
certain that the inferior MSS. frequently
introduce lines from other parts of the
poem into places where they have 110

usiness, 80 that it seems safest to print
the verse in brackets. In itself it is
sufficiently appropriate, in spite of a
slight verbal inconsisteucy with v. 107
though not necessary, as with ‘inquit’
the beginning of Sinon’s speech is not
very abrupt.
