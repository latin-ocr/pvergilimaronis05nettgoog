xlviii THE STORY OF AENEAS’ WANDEBINGS.

aud Anius are adopted by Virgil in his third Aeneid. No doubt the
similarity oi the names Anius and Aeneas has much to do with this
partos the legend. What the other evidences of Aeneas’ presence
there may have been Dionysius does not inform ns. A temple of
Aphrodite in the island of Cythera seems to have been the centre of a
story of Aeneas’ former presence there; Dionysius says that the
promontory of Κιναίθιον was named after Κίναιθσο, a companion of
Aeneas, who was there buried. In Zacynthus a solemn sacrifice to
Aphrodite, and athletic oontests for youths, kept up as late as the time
of Dionysius a memory oi Aeneas; the founder of Zacynthus was
supposed to be a son of Dardanus and brother of Erichthonius
Among the athletis contestu is especially mentioned a rece named
after Aphrodite and Aeneas, of whom two wooden statues were kept
in the island. In Leucas, Actium, and Ambracia there were, as we
have seen, temples to Aphrodite Aineias3 in Ambracia there was alec,
according to Dionysius, a wooden statue said to represent Aeneas,
which was honoured by yearly observances. In Buthrotum was
another temple of Aphrodite, the foundation of which was attributed
to Aeneas3 it was hom Buthrotum, according to Dionysius, that
Aeneas went to consult the oracle of Dodona. In the neighbourhood
of Buthrotum there was also a harbour-town bearing the name
Anchises.

So far, with the help of Dionysius, we have traced supposed
memorias of Aeneas in Thrace, in Delos, in Arcadia, in Cytheram
the promontory oi Cinaethium, in Zacynthus, in Leucas, Actium,
Ambracia, and Buthrotum. Passing on to the south of Italy we meet
with legenda which brought Aeneas and his followers to the promon-
tory of Iapygia inhabited by the Sallentini, and the harbour of
Aphrodite near the temple oi Athene (Aen. 3. 531, templumque apparet
ia erce Minervae) 3 here they only remain for a short time and then go
on to Sicily.

The legend which brought Trojan settlers to the north-west of
Sicily, Eryx, Elymus, and Segesta, was older than the time of Thucy·
dides, who expressly mentions and accepts it3 to follow it into the
details given by Dionysius is quite unnecessary. It is, however, of
great importunae as linking the story of Aeneas on one side with
Italy and on the other with Carthage. The main point for our
present consideration is the existence of a temple of Aphrodite
Aineias at Elymus; on some other features of the story we shall have
to remark further on.

The story oi Aeneas‘ voyage to Latium is undoubtedly later than
the legende which we have been considering. A whole chapter oi
Greek mythology, familiar enough to studente of that subject, con·
