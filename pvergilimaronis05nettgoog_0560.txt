486 . P. VERGILI MARON IS

Talibus Aeneas ardentem et torva tuentem

Lenibat dictis animum, lacrimasque ciebat.

Illa solo fixos oculos aversa tenebat,

Nec magis incepto vultum sermone movetur, 470
Quam si dura silex aut stet Marpesia cautes.

Tandem corripuit sese, atque inimica refugit

In nemus umbriferum, coniunx ubi pristinus illi
Respondet curis aequatque Sychaeus amorem.

Nec minus Aeneas, casu concussus iniquo, 475
