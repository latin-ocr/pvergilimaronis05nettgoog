2 P. VERGILI MARONIS

panied by those who followed his 11111111 irem Troy. The machinery by which
the sterm is allayed is perhaps managed mere adroitly 1)] virgil than 1)] Homer,
as there seems to be more propriety in representing the interior god 11 the winds as
countsracted by the superior god 11 tho sea, than in making 1 seo nymph reecue one
whom the god 11 the 'sea is secking te destroy. But ii virgil has obtained an
advantage over Homer, it is with the help 11 Hemer's weapons‚ 11 the interview
between June and Aeolus obviously owes its existence to the interview between
Here and the God 11 Sleep. The dialogus et' Venus and Jupiter appears to be
another appropriatien from Naevius: but, as in the former case, Virgil seems to
have established his right te what he has berrowsd 1)] the perfect fltness with which
a propheey 11 the destiny 11 Reme is introduced at the commoneament 11 1 poem
intended 11 be a monument 11 Reman greatness. The remaining incidente 11 the
First Book need net detain us much longer. As a general 1111, they are berrowed
hom Romen but we may admira the skill with which Virgil has introduced varie·
111111 detail, as where Ulysses, listening to sengs about Troy, reappears in Aeneas
loeking at sculpturas er paintiugs 11 Trojan subjeets, and the art with which
a new impression is produced by a combination 11 old materiale, in making the
friendly power that receives Aeneas unite the blandishments 11 Calypso with the
hospitality 11 Alcinous, and se engraiting a 111111 passion on a narrative 11
ordinary adventura The suggestiones the employment 11 Cupid 1)] Venus was
evidently taken irem the lean oi Aphrodite's cestus in Homer and the assistance
rendered 1)] the God 11 Leve in Apollonius3 bnt the treatment 11 the thought is
original and happy; and the few lines which describe the removal 11 Ascanius to
Idalia might themselves suggest a subject 111 peetry te some Keats er Shelley‚ in
whose mind the seed easnally dropped 1)] Virgil should expand and germinate.
