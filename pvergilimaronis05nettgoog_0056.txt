’1 THE STORY OF AENEAS' WANDERINGS.

was destroyed at Caiete,⁴ according to another, adopted by Virgil iu
his fifth Aeneid‚ in Sicily, where the interventiou of Neptune partially
defeats the malice of J nno.

Dionysius mentions many other Greek historiens who dealt with
the foundation of Rome, but, perhaps, fortunately for us, has not

chronicled their opinions. Some of these may be found in Verrius
Flaccus (Fest. p. 257—9, s. 1. Rana). So far we have seen that the
Greek writers 91 the fourth century before Christ claimed Greek
connexione and a mythical Greek foundation for Rome. There is no
sign of any Trojan playiug a prominent part in the drama: the
Trojan clement is represented only by captive women. But probably
iu consequence of the wars with Greece which began with the
beginning 91 the third century 119. the Romans adopted a different
version of their own from that offered hythe Greeks. The historiar
Timaeus, the long period 91 whose literary activity coincides in grem
part with that 91 the Roman wars against Pyrrhus, examined the
Penates et Lavinium, and prouounced the clay of which they were
made, together with the heralds’ staves 91 brass and iron, to be of
Trajan manufacture. Ernst Curtius (Sparta aad Olympia, iu the
fourteenth volume 91 the meee) has remarked upon the prominent
part which was played by centres of religions observauce‚ such as
Delphi and Olympia, iu the work of joining or dividing alliances iu
the world 91 ancient Graece. It is a sign of the same tendency of
feelings and ideas which appears in the claim now laid by the Romans
to the Penates of Troy. Pyrrhus, it will be remembered, boasted
his descent from Achilles. The Romans on their side claimed as
their ancestor the greatest of the Trojan princes who survived the
191191 his country. Traces of Aeneas 9111111196εώ μεγάλοι were found,
as we have seen, throughout Hellas and in Sicily3 it was only a step
further to bring him to Latium and give to Rome not a Greek bnt a
Trojan liueage. The anti-Hellenic interest dominant at this time
made the Romans eager tc seiza upon a religions symbol which scon
became the contre of a developed legend. The story of the foundation
of Rome by Aeneas formed part 91 the history 91 Fabius Pictor, and
had therefore assumed full shape by the end 91 the third century 99.

Livius Andronicus indeed (284-204 nc.) had adopted the story
which made Aeneas with Antenor betray Ilium to the Greeks—a
version of quite a different complexiou from that which implied the
irreconcilable enmity 91 Troy and Greoce. And it may be noticed
iu this connexion that there are signs in the case 91 other places,
besides Rome, of a double legend, one assigning to them a Greek,
