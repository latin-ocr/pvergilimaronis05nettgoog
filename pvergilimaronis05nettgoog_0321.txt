01 the fourth Book 01 the Aeneid little remeius to be added to what 1110 been
already said in the general Introduction. Its subject 1100 made it the most attractiva,
perhaps 1110 most celebrated, part of 1110 poem: it hus provolred much controversy,
aud that ofa kind which 111011 11101001101 only for the scholar, but for the general
rosdon much 01 11 hes been supposed 10110 horrowed from a particular Greek writer,
whose work happens 10 be preserved: 11 10 the 11001 0111111110 portion 01 the Aeneid,
and as 01011 may be viewed in 10101101 10 the masterpieees 01 Greek 1110110110 011
’1110001110 111 points which appear to belong 10 the sphere of Virgilian criticism in
general, whether aesthetio or antiquariae: and 11 seemed natural to disouss them 11
that connexion. For 1110 questions 1110101 Aeneas' treatment 01 Dido, of Virgil’s
obligations 10 Apollonius Rhodius, and 01 his relations, general and special, to the
Greek drama, I must refer my readers 10 what Ihsve said already.

Naevius, 101110 been remarked in the general Introduction, is supposed to have
preceded Virgil in 1110 anachronism 01 bringing Aeneas and Dido together* As 11110
fact is itself 1 matter 01 1110101100, we 0011101 01 course 1011 whether he made their
parting tragioal or otherwise. all that we know connecting Naevius with the story
01 this bools is that he mentioned Anna, Dido’s sister, who appears now in Virgil 101
the first time How this personage cameto be complicated with 1110 legendary history
01 Rome is not clear ; her name however, which is Carthaginien, lilre Hanno, Han-
nibal, dte, led 10 her identification with Anna Perenne, the Roman goddess 01 the
year, and Ovid (Fasti, 3. 523 foll.) reoounts or inventa a story 01 her following
Aeneas to Italy. Iu Virgil she is merely the confidente 01 the heroine, 10111110101
which has 11000110 0 stoolr one at certain periods 01 the history 01 the drama, espe-
cially since the 01101110 came 10 be excluded from the 101101. 11 other respacis Virgil
would seem simply 10 have taken the traditioual story of Dido, and modiliod it as
was requiredbythe necessity of blendingherdestiny with 111101101010. According
101110 most detailed accounts, 10 epitomized in the Dictionary 01 Biography, Dido's
early history up 101110 11110011101 landing in Africa coincides substantially with that
narrated by Venus to Aeneas 11 Book 1; afterwards she is persecuted by 1101 neigh-
bour, King Iarms, who demands ber hand: 0110 resolves to avoid him by death,
010010 0 funeral pile under the pretence of 1 sacrifice 10 propitiata her former
husband, and kills herself there. Virgil turns 1110 10101000 queen into a passionete
lover, keeping however the groundwork 01 the character, devotion to the memory 01
