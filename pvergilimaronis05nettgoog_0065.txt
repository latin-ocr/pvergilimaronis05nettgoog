So familiar are we with the story of the Aeneid that we arc apt to
forget what violence it does to the tradition generally current in
Virgil’s time. That tradition is represented by the third Aeneid3
there Aeneas is brought as far as Sicily, after a course 61 wandering
corresponding fairly with that described by Idvy end Dionysius. But
in order to bring in the new clement of the story, Aeneas must be
carried to Carthago from Sicily before 116 can be allowed to go on to
Latium. 'l'he fifth book, as it now stands, implies a second visit
to Sicily after the tragedy of Carthage. It 16 difficnlt to suppose that
so awkward a combination as this can have entered into the original
plan 61 the Aeneid. As things now stand it might occur to the reader
that the fifth Aeneid would naturally have followed the third, as the
sixth might naturally have followed the fourth. Virgil had not,
probably, at 'the time of his death, harmoniaed the Sicilian and
Carthaginien episodes in a manner satisfactory to himself.

The way in which Virgil‚ 161 the purposes 61 his epic, has altered
the story of Dido, is as striking and characteristic as anything in the
whole range 61 his poetry.⁷ In the universally accepted tradition
Dido's tragic end was due to her resolution not to become the wife 61
Iarbas3 and what in Virgil is represented as coming upon her as a
curse for the breach 61 her vow is, in the genuine story, the honourable
result 61 her constancy. No doubt Virgil felt that Varro’s version 61
the story, according to which not Dido, but her sister, was samificed
for love 61 Aeneas, would have been tame and pointless 16 his epic
poem; he therefore ventured on a bolder ssight, and carried the day.
No payt of the heroid, if we may trust Ovid, was mors eagerly read
than the fourth b00k; and all readers were forced to scknowledge the
skill with which he made their tears flow in a fictiticua cause.

In comparing Virgil’s account of the early fortunas of Dido with
that 61 Pompeius Trogus (Justin 18. 4-6) the reader is struck with
some minute coincidences of language which may show that both
writers drew upon the same source, but that Virgil for the sake 61
brevity mutilated the narrative. Takethe two accounts 61 Dido's
flight from Tyro. Sychaeus, it will bo remembered, is in Trogus’
narrative called Acerbas.

Jnstin 18. 4. 8, pac (farra) iacemus Pygmalion oblitos 16616 hamoni

6666661661 auam 6661166666 perseam sine respectu pietatis occidit.
Dido then is Pygmalion’s daughter, and great-nicee 61 her husband.
In Virgil Pygmalion is only the 96666666 of Dido, Aen. 1. 346, sed
regna ibri 96666666 babebat Pygmalion, scelere ante alios immanior
616666. . . . Ille Sychaeum Impius 6616 arcs atque 6661 666666 amore
Clam sarcinatricem mtpcrat, securus amorum Gerasenos. Justin l. c.
