i jeoture: it is another to oolleot all the readings of aoopy with-
out knowing what place it holds among the members of one or
other of the various familias of MSS. through whieh the text of
a popular elassieal author has been transmitted to us, or indeed
before it has been distinetly ascertained what those families are,
and what their history has been. A aritio of the Now Testament
may be laudably employed in establishinga theory of reeensions
induetively by the examination of eursire no less than unoial
MSS.; but in the present state ol elassioal studies we shall

. probably have to wait long before any one will think it worth
, while to quality himself for writing a detailed history of the text

of Virgil

In reporting MS. readings I have in general made a seleetion
from Ribbeek’s materiale, noting all suoh variations as appeared
of any sort of importunae, and rejecting only those whieh seemed
obvious errore, pointing to nothing but the carelessness of the
transcribet. The ease is one where it is difficolt to draw the
line; and I fear I shall be thought with reason to have done too
little for scholare, too much for ordinary readers. . Ι am sorry to
say thatI have not been consistent in speaking of different classes
of readings in the same oopy: in the ease of the Medioeanl have
discriminated what are ealled the first or seeond reading from
what are ealled the reading ‘amanu prima’ or ‘ seeunda ;’ in the
ease of the other MSS] have for the most part spoken more
generally, talking of ‘original’ or ‘corrected' readings. Were
the work to be done again I should adopt the general designa·
tion in all cases, as better suited to the ordinary reader: as it is
I trust the discrepanoy will be pardoned.

The commentaries whioh I have used have been in general the
same as those employed for the Eologues and Georgica. I hare
lost the eompanionsbip of ΜΓ. Keightley, and have gained that
of Gessrau and Dr. Henry. Gossrau’s commentary is neat and
oompendious, more convenient than Forbiger’s, though not so full,
and with more traees of independent judgment. He has studied
Servius with aare, and quotes him at times very appositely : and
