Iu the Third Book Virgil treads yet more closely in the steps 01 Homer, the subject
being the wanderings ol Aeneas, as that oi the Ninth and three following books oi
the Odyssey ie the wanderings 01 Ulysses. The time embraced by the present
narrative is not much shorter than that eomprehendad by its prototypo: indeed, it
is considerably longer, aa ol Ulysses‘ ten years seven are spent with Calypso, and oi
these we have no record: but Virgil lelt that the second narrator mast be brieier
than the first, and accordingly conuaoted hia story into a single book. Toacertain
extem it vsa almost necessary that there shonld be a coincidence in the details 01
the two accounts aa well aa ln the original plan. The mythical geography 01 Homer
had become part of the apic commonplace though, like the mythical history, it uae
modilled lreely, not followed servilely: and as Aeneae was wandering in the same
parte ae Ulysses, and at the sometime, it would have been unustursl to make their
experiences altogether independent and dissimilar. Yet the only place in which the
two lines 01 adventure actually touch is when they enter the country 01 the Cyclope:
and there Virgil has skiliully contrived not tc rival Homer's story, bnt te appropriate
it, and to make Aeneas reap the benedt ol Ulyssea’ experience without being
obliged torepeat it in his own person. For hia other incidente he isindcbted partly
to other portione 01 the body ol heroic legend, partly to his own invention. Polydorus
ia from the Greek drama; the bleeding myrtle, however, may be Virgil's own, though
Heync, with n judicial “videtur,” gives the credit oi lt to the chlic poete: the
adventure with the Harpies was suggested by Apollonius, who aleo, ae we have seen
iu the general Introduction, gava hints lor the predictions 01 Helenus end the
deliveranee ci Achemenides: other legende, noticed in Heyne's first Excursns, seem
to have given the outline 01 the voyage, indicating the several places touched at·
'I'he mistakee made in searching tor the new kingdom, the scene nt Delos, the appear·
enee oi the Penates, tbe meeting with Andromache, seem all to be more or lese
omginal. Segraia notes that the interest of tha book has suffered from its position
between two ci the noblest portione oi the poem: and Hcyne observes that it is not
generally apprecieted because the reader does not possess adaquato knowledge 01
the minute particulare oi legendary history, geography, and antiquitiea which the
poet has indicated by transient and remota allusione.

Heyne hae been at the palus to distinguish tbe seven years over which Virgll
distributae his hero'a wanderings. Troy, according to the almost universal tradition,
was taken in the summer. The winter cithia year, which oonnts as the first oi the
seven, is spent by Aeneae in those preparatione oi which we read vv. 5 loll. He
salleio the spring or summer oi the second year (v. 8), and spends the winter in
thrace, where he builds a city. The tragedy oi Polydorus drives him away in the
