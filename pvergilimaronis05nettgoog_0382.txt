308 P. vanam MARONIS

Sic adeo insistit, secumque ita corde volutat:

Iussa sequar? quiane auxilio iuvat ante levatos,

Et bene aput memores veteris stat gratia facti?

Quis me autem, fac velle, sinet, ratibusve superbis 640
Invisum accipiet? nescis heu, perdita, necdum
Laomedonteae sentis periuria gentis?
