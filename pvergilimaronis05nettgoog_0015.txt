Tun following remarks comprisa the greater part of the original
Prefaoe prefixed to this volume on its publication in 1863, with
some alterations audone or two additions.

Like its predecessor, this volume is the result of considerable
labour, labour too of a kind which tends to diminish an author's
confidence in his work A commentator on Virgil is not likely
to feel that those difficulties which weighed heavily on him while
· engaged on the Eclogues and Georgica have become lewcr or less
formidable when he pasees to the Aeneid. To grapple with his
subject thoroughlygha is still required to be an aesthetieal judga
cf language, a Latin scholar, if not a philclcger, a competent
amuel critic; and though no longer expected to display a know·
lcdge of agriculture and rural life, hc has to exhibit instead an
a acquaintance with mythology and legend, with Roman antiquities
and Roman history. Virgil is confessedly one of the most learned

’ 05 pocta: and a commentator who would do him justice ought to
bc still more learned. The learning oi a poet, eren when extensive
= and multifariam, may be desultory, uncritical‚ inexact: he may
show ignoranoe as well as knowledge, but he will bea learned

poet still Itis the business of a commentator to understand both
that knowledge and that ignoranae: and his learning accordingly
Γ oughttcbe accurate,searching‚and profound. Ineednotsayhow
