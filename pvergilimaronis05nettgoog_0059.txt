THE STORY OF AENEAS’ WANDERINGS. liii

Dionysius seems on this point to have followed the seme authorities
as Virgil, ior the notion thet the Trojans are oi Hellenic raoe is
followed out by Virgil with tolerabis consistency in his selection of
proper names. His Trojans have mostly Greek names: Actor,

A numinenumine, Anchemolus, Anthene, Aphidnas, Aebutca Capys,

Castor, Chone, Chloreus, Chromis, Cluuius, Clytius, Corynaeus, Cretheus,
Diores, Dymas, Erioetes, Mrymas, nyes, and the like. The Italian

r numm, on the other haud, are ranged on the eide of Turnus: Almo,
’ Amata, Anxur, Aquicolus, Arretius, Astur, Atinas, Auentinus, Caedicus,

Comme, Camilla, Cetbeyus, Clausus, Cupencus, Ebulc, Ebusus, Padus,
Halesus, Herbesus, Hisbo, Lausus, Myer, hocopus, Inmetius, Magus,
Messapus, Metabus, Metiscus, Mezentius, Murranus, Numa, Numanus,
Numitor, Quercens, Rapo, Remulus, Remus, Sacrator, Salius, Sarranus,
Sucro, Sulmo, Tiburtus, Pulla, Ufens, Umbro, Valerus, Vernulas, Virbius,
Volcens, Volusus. ⁸

'Phe story of Aeneas' allicnce with the Arcadian Evander points, Ι
need hardly edd, iu the same direction. I do not know whether a
truce oi the same idea is to be found in theory supported by Cato,
Acilius, aud many other Roman historiens, that the Aborigines, with
whom the Trojens eventually united, were Greeks who had comato

think, he perceived in the account of the part played by Diomed in the ’

later story of Aeneas. Cassius Hemina, the historiari of the end of
the second century ac, represented Diomed as giving the Palladium
to Aeneae when the latter was passing through Calabria. According
to Varro, Diomed also gave Aeneae the bones of his father Anchises.
And Virgil, iu the eleventh Aeneid, represents the attempte of the

Iret ns now for a few momente consider the clemente of Italian

= mythology aud religione observauce which blonded with the Greek

table just mentioned. The familiar names Lacinium, Laurentum,

¹ Alba, Penates, Indipes, Diuturna, Amata, Camilla, are genuine Italian

words, and as ench point back to a condition of politice and religion
long prior to the introduction oi the Hellenic legend. Schwegler hae
rightly pointed out that the Italian contre of the story is lavinium or

Iamo-Lavinium, not Rome. Lavinium, if not the political at least
the religione capital of the Alban langue, continued down to a very
late time tc preserve living hares of its ancient importunos. At
lavinium were the Penates of the Latine and their worship; at
Iruvinium the consuls, praetore, and dictatore offered sacrifice when
catering upon or leying down their publio functione. Macrobius 3. 4.
