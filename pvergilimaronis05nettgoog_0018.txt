found, I think, to be in a case which, to a transcriber, was really
a case of spelling, such as ‘ Cyclopius’ for ‘ Cyclopeus,' or ‘deri-
pere' for ‘diripere' Here I am sorry to say Ribbeck is still less
to be commended than in the choice of MS. readings. In several
places he has introduced emendations into the text, generally
conjectures of his own, which arsin every cese, in my judgment,
worse than needless: nor is he in general more happy in his
attempts to point out interpolatione or to indicate lacunae.
Hitherto the text of Virgil has enjoycd asingular immunity from
arbitrary criticism. ln the last century, while Horace was being
transformed alternately by the splendid audacity oi Bentley and
the more formal and pedantic dogmatism of Cunningham, Virgil
remained nearly in the state in which Heinsius had left him.
Ounningham indeed proceeded from Horace to Virgil, whose text
he reformed in obedience to certain canons which he supposed
himself to have drawn from a scrutiny of the best MSS.; but

from the absence of the eclat which attended a controversy with
en adversary like Bentley, even when that adversary declined to
reply, or perhaps because the labours of Heinsius rested on a basis
too firm to be easily disturbed. Gilbsrt Wakefield, towards the
end of the century, edited both Horace and Virgil: but his
attempta et innovaticn were too desultory seriously to effect
either. Probably the greatest amount of misapplied ingenuity
that has been bestowed on Virgil, till we come to Peerlkamp in
the present century, is to be found in the conjectures of Schrader,
which I know only as reported by Heyne and Ribbeck. They
are always, or almost always ingenious, showing that degree cf
insight which is required to perceive an anomaly cf expression,
and that degree of tect which hits on a word that might possibly
heve been used instead ; bnt there their praise must cease. Such
ingenuity is,I believe, almost wholly inapplicable to an author
like Virgil, whose text, supported as it is by an ample variety cf
testimony, requires not emendation but illustration. If he has
