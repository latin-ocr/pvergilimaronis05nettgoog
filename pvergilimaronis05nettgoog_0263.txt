AENEID. LlB. III. 189

Fama volat pulsum regnis cessisse paternis ·
Idomenea ducem, desertaque litora Cretae,
Hoste vaoare domum, sedesque astare relictas.
Linquimus Ortygiae portus, pelagoque volamus,
Bacchatamque iugis Naxon viridemque Donysam, 125
Olearon, niveamque Paron sparsasque per aequor
Cycladas et crebris legimus freta concita terris.
Nauticus exoritur vario certamine clamor; '⁸
Hortantur socii: Cretam proavosque petamus.
Prosequitur surgens a puppi ventus euntis, 130
Et tandem antiquis Curetum adlabimur oris.
