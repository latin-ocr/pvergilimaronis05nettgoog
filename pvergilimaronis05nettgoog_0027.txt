INTRODUOTION. xxi ι

66 116 story which, supported as itis by the authority 61 116 elder
Pliny,⁸ there seems 66 reason 16 doubt, that Virgil himself, when
dying, condemned hie Aeneid 16 116 flames. Rightly understood,
thet story seems 16 6661616, 661 6 6661666166 1161 16 had mistaken his
powers, but simply one more instance 61 116 fastidious aud exacling
nature 61 116 aelf-criticism. The explanationis consonant to all 1161
66 know 61 Virgil’s character, as shown in his writings; and it
cen only be a private opinion which we may ourselvcs entertain
about the merit 61 116 poem that would lead us to seek for any
other. Suetonius tells us that Virgil was overtaken by death at the
time when he was intending to spond three years in polishing and
elaborating the Aeneidz and we may imagine for ourselves what
would be the value 61 three years 61 correction in the judgment 61
apoet like Virgil, and how abortiva he might consider the work which
had lost the advantage 61 66 long a gestation. We cannot, indeed,
1611, except in a very few obvious 66666, 6661 as the hemistichs, and
perhaps also certain inconsistencies in 116 narrative, 61 which I have
spoken elsewhere,l what may have been the actual shortcominge 61
116 poem 66 they appeared to 116 author. He may have introduced
umes, as the story says 16 did, which were intended 66 mere tempo·
rary make-shifts,⁸ props to stay 116 building until more solid supports
should ba forthcoming3 but modern criticiem has notin general been
very happy in pointing 66111666 weak places, aud for the present we
616116 6661661 16 admit thetae regards 116 execution 61 116 poem,
et'eny rate, our conceptione 61 what 16 required 1611 infinitely short 61
Virgil’s cwn; and that though we may hope, in some measure, to ι
appreciata what he has done, we can form 66 661166 61 what he left
yet 16 dc. Such au admissicn 61 ignorance is uo more than the
tribute which we pay, naturally and cheeriully, to a consummate
artist In any case, we need not doubt that the feeling which made
11ςί] wish to rob 116 world 61 116 greatest poem was simply the
mortification of leaving in a state 61 comparative imperfection a work
which he had intended to bc his masterpiece. 'I'o imagine that he
was sensible 61 116 unreality which, 16 6 certain extent, characteriaes
116 Aeneid, as compared with the Homeris poema, is to imagine an
anachronism and an impossibility, 16 attribute to him 6 thought which
ἰ1166666161661 with the whole tenor 61 116 writings, and must have
baeu alien to the entire canant of sentiment among his contemporaries,

whether admiring or adverse. He seems never 16 have tormented
himself with doubts that he had not realised the rustic vigour of ,
