xlii AENEIS.

should have had more charms for Virgil, the perfecter of the Latin

hexameter, than it had for Ennius, who was the first to supplent it by
the etately Grecian exotic.

The identity oi matre at once establishes a closer affinity between
Virgil and Ennius than can ever have existed between the poet of the
Aencid and the poet of the Punic War. As a matter of fact we know
that many lines in the Aeneid arc taken, more or lese changed, from
the Annals3 indeed, we owe the preservation oi not a few of Ennius’s
hexameters to the early critice who pointed out the imitatione of them
in Virgil. Every reader oi the Aeneid will remember lines resembling
“ Qui caelum versat stellis fulgentibus aptum,'’ “Teque pater Tiberine
tuo cum flumine sancto,” ‘⁶ Cum superum lumen nox intempesta tene-
ret,’' “ Ansat-is concurrunt undique telis,'' “Romani scalis summa
nituntur opum vi‚'’ “Quis potis ingentis oras evolvere belli Ρ ” “ Semi-
animesque micant oculi lucemque requirunt; '’ lines, some oi which,
when we meet them in Virgil, stn'ke us with no want oi smoothness Ι
or finish, while others, though somewhat rougher‚ serve to vary the
harmony which they do not really interrupt. The Latin hexameter,
under all its modification, hae characteristics which distinguish it from
the Greek, and as Ennius was its originator, he may claim to be the
author of Virgil’s versification, even in cases where nothing like imita
tion can be pretended. Ennius did not naturalize his new importation
until the languege into which it was introduced had lost some portion
oi its original plasticity3 he had accordingly, as has been ably shown
Α by a German writer,⁶ to adopt a certain conventionalism of expression,
innovating here, paraphrasing there, in order to avoid obvious words
which happened to be unsuitable to his mctre; and though Virgil was
not likelytofollow him in his harsher ‘ tours de force,’ the same necessity
which pressed on the elder poet pressed 011 the younger also, making
him fall into the style of epic commonplace which already existed, and
augment it by a thousand new and ingenious devices of his own. All
this we may admit, as we have made similar admissione in the case of
Apollonium yet it may still be true that Virgil’s debt to Ennius isso
trifling as to be scarcely worth computation. We know too little ot
Ennius to be able to estimate his menits asa narrator; hundreda ot his
verses have come down tc us, but very few passages which exceed
three or sentimas, and ot these scarcely any can be called pieces of
narrative. There isindeedadcscription of an invincible tribune in the
Histrian war, bathed in sweat and exposed to a hailstorm of javelius‚
which Vir-gil doubtless had before him while painting Turnus et the ,
eud of the uinth Aeneid3 bnt the model is itself a copy from the
single-hauded resistance oi the Homeric Ajax in the sixteenth Iliad,
