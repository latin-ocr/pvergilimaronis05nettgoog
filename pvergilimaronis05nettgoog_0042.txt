xxxvi AENEIS.

where her more than feminine logio is overpowercd by the superior
logic of Hecuba, intensified by hatred, made it easier ior Virgil to
represent her as he has done in the second and sixth books oi the
Aeneid, though that representation, as I have said previously, was
forced upon him by the circumstances ci his story, and is sufficiently
justified by them. So it was natural that Aeneas should be antipa·
thetio to Ulysses; but the grounds of antipathy are strengthened by
the later Greek representatione oi the wily Greek, who is made, by a
substitution characteristic cf an Athenian writer during the Pelopon·
nesian war, to exchange his part of a popular counsellcr for that oi a
mere mob orator, and whose nobler qualities are transferred to a rival
character, Palamedes, oi whom heis the enemy and treacherous mur·
derer. Probably, alec, there arc situations which Virgil has conveyed
from the Greek drama less directly and openly. One such I seem to
observa in the steps by which Dido approaches the resolution oi
putting heraclito death, talking freely and wildly of the thought
while it is only a thought, careiully concealing it when it has passed
into a purpose. This appears to me to have been suggested by that
celebrated change oi feeling in the Ajax of Sophocles, who in one
scene breathes nothing but seli-destruction, and in the next is vvon to
a calmness which the subtlety of modern critice will not allow to bc ·
altogether seigned. Of such slight matters as the actual appropria
tion oi phrases and forms cf expression, this is not the place tc speak.
They are far hom numerous, and will be found noticed, so far as I
have observed them, in the notes. But it is not less true that Virgil’s
debts ior language and phraseology, tc one at least of the masters of
Athenian tragedy, are real and great. That which is so remarkable
a feature of Virgil's style, his practice oi employing combinatione of
words so constructed as tc remind the reader oi other aud yet other
combinatione, could hardly be better illustrated than by a comparison
of the language oi Virgil with the language oi Sophocles.l '

The Argonautics ci Apollonius Rhodius would have their valna ior
the critic of the Aeneid, if only as the single representative which has
come down to us oi the later epic poetry oi Graece. A poet like

Virgil, studious tc embody in himself all that was best in previous
’ culture, could not be wholly independent of writers whose conception
of their art was so far analogous to his own, that they strove to
represent the Homeris spirit under more modern forms: and the
Alexandrian school in particular must have had singular attractione for
the chiei poetical artist of an era which itself displayed so many of the
