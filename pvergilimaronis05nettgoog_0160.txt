1 86 Ρ. VERGILI MARONIS

oredited by the silenos of other authorities, whose ignorauoe contrusis strangely with
this schoolboy knowledge; and Heym, iu his flrst Exeursus to this book, has mado
it mora than probable that the plagiarium of the poet is really the blunder of the
eritis, who is supposed ιο have oonfounded two Pisanders, one who lived before
Virgil, hut did not write the mythologieo-historieal poem, and another who did write
the poem, but lived after llirgil.¹ The little that we know from Servius aud others
about the treatment oi the stories of Laoooon sud Sinon by earlier writers points
rather ιο differente from Virgil's version than to identity with it: aud though we
must uot build so muolr on this, as it is the wont of suoh witnesses to dwell rather
on points of dissimilarity thau on points of agreement, we may take it ss showing
that Virgil did really exmoise his privilege of varying the smaller eiroumstauoes of
the narrative, espeoially as his sueoassors, Quinotus Smyrnaeus and Tryphiodorus,
who are supposed ιο have been diligent oopyists of the early writers, differ from him
oonsiderably in their manner of treatment. At any rste, whatever may have been
Virgil’s obligations ιο his predeoessors for the iuoideuts of his narrative, we osnnot
doubt that ihs golden thread whieh runs through the whole, the feeling of Aeneas
himself, is substautially his own. The steps by whieh the hero eomes ιο realize his
position as au inhabitant oie captured city, a partisau of a oauso against whieh the
gods have ilually deelmed-steps iudioated with suoh subtlety that it is only of late
that they have been fully reeognized (see ou vv. 322, 402),—are not likely ιο have
been transmitted by legend, while they bear iu themselves the strongest marks of
the poet's pesuliar art ⁴

Perhaps there is no better way oi estimating the greatuess of Virgil iu this book
then by glauciug at the manner in whioh the subjeot has been treated by the three
later poete, Smyrnaeus, Tryphiodorus‚ and Teetzes. With his example before thena
not to mention the other writers whom they probably followed, they have yet oon·
trived ιο divest a most stirriug and pathetie story of a large part oi its interest.
Smyrnaeus bestows two of his fourteeu books, tho twelfth and the thirteeuth, ou the
ospture of Troy. He goes over mueh the sams ground as virgil: but his narrative
isflat and lifeless: tho incidente do not flow out of eaoh other, aud sometimes,
instead of incident, we are put off with the tedlous generality of a mere historioal

ptolemus aud Philoctetes, like Milton‘s Molooh, are for open war, and attempt to
lead their people to battle atonee, but are oheoked by a thuuderbolt from Zeus,
which quiteoverawes them: an iuoideut briefly despatched, and apparently intro·
