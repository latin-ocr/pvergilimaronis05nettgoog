AENEID. ΠΒ. IV.

Iam mare turbari trabibus, saevasque videbis·

Conlucere faces, iam fervere litora flammis,

Si te his attigerit terris Aurora morantem. .

Femina Sic fatus nocti se inmiscuit atrae. tta
Tum vero Aeneas, subitis exterritus umbris,

Corripit e somno corpus sociosque fatigat3

Praecipites vigilate, viri, et considite transtris3

Solvite vela citi. Deus aethere missus ab alto

Festinare fugam tortosque incidere funis 111

Ecce iterum instimulat. Sequimur te, sancte deorum,

Quisquis es, imperioque iterum paremus ovantes.
