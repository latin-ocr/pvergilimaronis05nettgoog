,nauum LIB. V.

Ipse, caput tonsae foliis evinctus olivae,

Stans procul in prora pateram tenet, extaque salsos svs
Proicit in fluctus ac vina liquentia fundit.

Prosequitur surgens a puppi ventus euntis.

Certatim socii feriunt mare'et aequora verrunt.

At Venus interea Neptunum exercita curis
Adloquitur, talisque effundit pectore questus: 7⁸0
Iunonis gravis ira nec exsaturabile peetus
Cogunt me, Neptune, preces descendere in omnis ;
Quam nec longa dies, pietas nec mitigat ulla,

Nec Iovis imperio fatisque infracta quiescit.
