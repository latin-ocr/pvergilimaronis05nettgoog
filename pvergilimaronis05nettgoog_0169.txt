AENEID. LIB. Π.

Dardanidae, qui se ignotum venientibus ultro,

Hoc ipsum ut strueret Troiamque aperiret Achivis, 00
Obtulerat, fidens animi, atque in utrumque paratus,

Seu versare dolos, seu certae occumbere morti.

Undique visendi studio Troiana iuventus

Circumfusa ruit, certantque inludere capto.

Accipe nuno Danaum insidias, et crimine ab uno 00
Disce omnis.

Namque ut conspectu in medio turbatus, inermis,
Constitit atque oculis Phrygia agmina circumspexit:
Heu, quae nunc tellus, inquit, quae me aequora possunt
