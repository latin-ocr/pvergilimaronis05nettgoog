302 Ρ. VERGILI MARONIS

Haec se carminibus promittit solvere mentes,

Quas velit, ast aliis duras inmittere curas3

Sistere equam fluviis, et vertere sidera retro ;
Nocturnosque ciet Manis3 mugire ridebis 400
Sub pedibus terrem, et descendere montibus omos.
Testor, cara, deos et te, germano, tuumque

Dulce caput, magices invitam accingier artis.

Tu secreta pyram tecto interiore sub suras

Erige, et arms viri, thalemo quae fixe reliquit 100
