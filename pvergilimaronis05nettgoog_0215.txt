AENEID. LIB. 11. · 141

Apparent Priami et veterum penetralia regum,

Armatosque vident stantis in limine primo. 485
At domus interior gemitu miseroque tumultu

Miscetur, penitusque cavae plangoribus aedes

Femineis ululant; ferit aurea sidera elamor.

Tum pavidae teetis matres ingentibus errant,

Amplexaeque tenent postis atque osenla figunt. 490

Instat vi patria Pyrrhus; neo claustra, neque ipsi

Custodes sufferre valent3 labat ariete erebro

Ianua, et emoti procumbunt cardine postes.

Fit via vi; rumpunt aditus, primosque trucidant
