AENEID. LIB. V.

Custodem ad sese comitemque inpubis Iuli

Epytiden vocat, et fidam sic fatur ad aurem:

Vade age, et Ascanio, si iam puerile paratum

Agmen habet secum, cursusque instruxit equorum,
Ducat avo turmas, 01 sese ostendat in armis, 550

Dic, ait. Ipse omnem longo decedere circo
Infusum populum, et campos iubet esse patentis.
Incedunt pueri, pariterque aute ora parentum
