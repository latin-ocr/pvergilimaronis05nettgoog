xxviii AENEIS.

cardinal offence against history and ethnology staring him in the face,
Virgil would have found it in vain to effect oraim at accuracy.
Accordingly, he appeals indifferently to all the associatione of his
readers, whether vagae or exact. Here he takce advantage of an
obscure tradition3 theraci a loose popular identification. He talks
of Dorians at a time when the Doricus were scarcely known, and
confers on the Trojans the name of their Phrygian neighbours. He
generalizes from spart to the whole, and then comes down from the
whole to some other pa1t3 just as where, in describing the 'Projan
horse, he first speaks of it ae pina-wood‚ then es maple, and lastly as
oak3 not, I think, from confusion or forgetfulness, butas au assertion
of the poet’e privilege to represent, in as many ways as he plaased,
the general notion of wood. In short, he ie an artist, au Italian
antiquary, a Roman oi the Augustau period, speaking to the average
educated intelligence of his own day; he is anything rather than
what modern admirere of Homer would wish him to be, a hieropbaut
of “ the inner Homeric world,’' an expounder of “primitive history,
philosophy, policy, aud religiou,''⁰ as contained in Homer.

Such a course of independent rivalry, however, could hardly be
pureucd without provoking theconsequent Nemesis. A story of the
heroic time of Graece, treated in an essentially modern and Roman
spirit, was sure to leave asenec of incongruity on the mind, not only of
a Homeric student, but of a more popular reader. A reader cithia ,
sort might be utterly unconscioue of a thousand inaccuracies of coe·
tume3 he might feel the loss of primitive simplicity of manner to be
compensated by the greater statelinese of the modern heroic ; but he
could scarcely fail to be struck with an essential want of consistency in
tha drawing oi the principa] figures, which, being Homeric must neces-
sarily be old, and being Virgilian, mustea necessarily be new. Itis
thie, I think, which constitutos the secret of the dissutisfaction which
is generally felt with the characteres Aeneas. To represent him, as
some modern critias have done, as simply mean and feeblc‚ numanly
and unheroic, is unjnst, and even absurd. His appearances iu Homer
ought not to prejudice our opinion about his appearances in Virgi13
nor perhaps would they, were it notior an error in judgment oom-
mitted by the poet himself, who, in his spirit of dramatic fair dealings
towards hie hem’s enemies,-a spirit which will call for our notice
again very shortly—makes them tauut him with his Homeric escapee
and evasione of danger, allowiug them, at the same time, to coufound
what Homer never would have coufounded, and identify a warlike
Trojan with an effeminate Phrygian. We are wearied, it must be
conieesed, by being continnally reminded of his piety; though that
