P. VERGILI MARON IS

Et molem mirantur equi; primusque Thymoetes a
Duoi intra muros hortatur et arce locari,
Sive dolo, seu iem Troiae sie fata ferebant.
At Capys, et quorum melior sententia menti, 11

Praecipitare iubent, subiectisque urere flammis,
Aut terebrare cavas uteri et temptare latebras
Scinditur incertum studia in contraria volgus.
