xxvi AEN EIS.

according to that which regards his poems as 010000 01 advocacy, the
answers to which have beenlost. The image is indeed something
more than a mere metaphor. We know 1101 10 110 Greek schools 01
01010010 attempts were frequently made to overturn the verdict, not
only 01 history, 10101 10110; 001 we may recall with a smile 1101001
1101 11 was not merely sophistical acumen, but real sympathy with 0
friendly ration, which led Greek 0001000 to rehabilitate Busiris, and
purge Egypt from the stain 01 0 legendary participation 10 110 guilt
01 human sacrifices. Virgil has obtained leave 10 reargne the 0000 01

1010000000 should 10 0001 00 would have been credible 10 0 Trojan
warrior. Bearing this 10 mind, we may remember that 11 Aeneas 00110
Ulysses ‘⁶ fell,'’ “ relentless,” and “ the inventor 01 crime‚” it is when
heis speaking 01 110 sack 01 Troy, 00 01 110 carrying 011 01 110 010100
which made ’10001 impregnable. If Sinon represents him as 01000-
0100000, 001101 gloner, it 10 when he is describing plots laid against his
iriend’s 1110 001 110 own. lf Deiphobus knows him only as the coun-
00110001 1001001 wrong, we may pardon the 00001101 judgment 01 0
person who bas been hewn by him as 0 0000000 11 100 hounds, and
continues manglcd 0000 10 110 ghostly body. Such men were 001
likely to sympathise with the admiration expressed by the Homeris
Antenor, es, on the day that was 1ο bring 110 war 10 0 00000101 01000,

that the Aeneas 01 Virgil should appreciate the lights and shodes dis-
10110101 over the character 01 110 Homeric Helen. How he regarded
her during the siege we are not told3 he may have shared the mixed
