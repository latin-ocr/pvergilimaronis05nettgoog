lxii THE STORY OF AENEAS’ WANDERINGS.

leaderehip 01 Turnus, who is branded as 011 αὐτόμολος, desert the
alliance. Turnus fights 101 his lost love, and both he aud latinus
die in the battle.

The account giren by Dionysius tallias on the whole with that
attributed by Servius, Aen. 6. 760, 10 (late. The Etruscan element
in 1110 story, represented hy Mezentius, is 11001011 by Virgil quite in a

way 01 1110 own. For, however they may differ in details, the
tradition as given both by Cato and by the authorities whom Dio·
nysius follows reprcsents Mezentius as falling in 0 1101 which arose
some time after the death 01 Turnus. Mezentius ie indeed au ally
of Turnus, betis 1101 killed until after the final settlement 01 Aeneas
in his kingdom ; according 10 Cato, it was hy Ascanius, according to
Dionysius' authorities, by Aeneas himself, three years after the battle
in which Turnus and latinns were 010111. As in the case 01 Dido,
Virgil does violence to the accepted order 01 0101110. Turnus must be
slain before Aeneas 0011 finally obtain the hand 01 11011010, thus the
last half 011110 Aeneid is provided with its clement of romanoe3 and
Mezentius falls before Turnus in a warin which both 010 simul·
taneonsly engaged. ’

It is evident that Virgil had a tradition 01 traditione 10 work upon,
many 01 the details 01 which are now lost, bnt which 010111001 fully
preserved by Dionysius. Fragments 01 them 010 preserved by Servius
on Aen. 7. 51, 11111010 . . . dnoefllios 0010111010 patris Aeneae spondentes
sororem faotione interemit. . . Hos 0111 00000100 0 matre trudunt, pcat-
qnnm 0101000 Teneo Lavinio Aeneae innota cat. Docs this imply that
there was, independently 01 the Aeneid, aetery according to which
Turnus died before the marriage of Aeneas 0111111011ῃίοΡ In any
case it implics that Amata surwiwed Turnus, and this is different from
the account in the Aeneid. Another instance is mentioned by Asper,
quoted in the Verona scholia on Aen. 1401, Tyrrhum ciant fnisse
pastorem aput quent Lavinio 110111οί11011 0010 Ascanium liniens sopit in
011000. Hic Latini 01110110 dicitnr fnisse. (lomp. Serv. ad l.

The considerations on which I have been dwelling will be found, Ι
think, to throw some light on the difficulties with which Virgil had

to contend. The traditione on which alone he could work had
neither form nor 1110. Aeneas had 110101,οο 101 as wc can 0001101
even in the Homeric poema, been a hero in the sense in which the

. word can be used of Achilles, Ulysses, Ajax, or Diomed. Even in

Homer the protection 01 Aphrodite and Apollo hange heasily around
him. In the place where he is worshipped heisa mere name; a
shadowy demi-god associated with the worship 01 Aphrodite. As 0
founder of cities he has no characteristic to distinguish him from the
many fabulous 0111010101 Greek and Italian towns, The Homeric
