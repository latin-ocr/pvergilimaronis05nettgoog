174 Ρ. VERGILI Minonis AENEID. LIB. ΙΙ.

ἡρωικά lenham. speaking ol this work, Zosimus (5. 29) says, Πείσανδρος, l ηῖ
τῶν ἡρωικῶν demasic ἐπιγραφῇ πᾶσαν es clasis ἱστορίαν περιλαβών. It appears to
me that the poem mentioned by Macrobius cannot he either oi these Not the
Ἡράκλεια ol the older Pisandes, which can hardly have included the capture ol
¹1¹roy hy Agamemnon end Ulysses. Not the ποικίλη loropla ol the younger, lor 1
cannot bring mysell to believe that Macrobius could have been guilty ol so gross a
mlatalre as to accuse Virgll ol copying from a ariter who lived in the age oi
Alexander Severus Macrobius speaks ol Pisander in the same breath with
Theocritus, Hesiod, and Aratus: in what he says of Virgil's relation to these poeta
he (or his authority) is, from hls own pointel vien, right enough; why should he
be mistalren about Pisander? Nor again, in spite ol the words ol mimus, doI
think theta work such aa Macrobius attributes to Pisander could well have borne

the title ἡρωικά teoydyam. It seeum rather to have been a continuans chroniole, ,

anch as may well have haued from the study ol some earlier or later Alexandrian

Itis true that no ancient wrlter but Macrobius mentiens this Pisander. But too
mnoh stram should not be lald on this consideration. In Gellius, Servius, and
Macrobius we have only a fragment ot the literary oritloiam ol ancient Italy. To
take another materne, we may remember that Virgil's deht to Parthenius seems to
have been not inconsiderable (see Gellius 9. 9. s, 13. 27. l), yet Parthenius is never
mentioned by Servius.

1 suppose then that there really was a poem bearing the name ol Pisandes to
which Virgil was in some way indebled sor some parta at least oi his story ln the
second Aeneid. Whether, however, there was really a third Pisander who wrote
the poem, or whether ,it was, aa Welelrar thlnlrs, lalaely attributed to the older
author, there seeum to be little chance ol deoiding.

Bernhardy, it should be added, agrees with Heyne on this question. -Η, N.]
