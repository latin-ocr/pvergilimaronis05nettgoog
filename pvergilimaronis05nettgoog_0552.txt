478 P. VERGILI MARONIS

Fatalis virgae, longo post tempore visum,
anruleam advertit puppim, ripaeque propinquat. 410
Inde alias animas, quae per iuga longa sedebant,
Deturbat, laxatque foros3 simul accipit alveo
Ingentem Aenean. Gemuit sub pondere cumba
Sutilis, et multam accepit rimosa paludem.
Tandem transfluvium incolumis vatemque virumque 115
Informi limo glaucaque exponit in ulva.
Cerberus haec ingens latratu regna trifauci
Personat, adverso recubans immanis in antro.
Oui vates, horrere videns iam colla colubris,
Melle soporatam et medicatis frugibus offam 420
