 

THE STORY OF AENEAS’ WANDERINGS. lvii

from Livius Andronicus in not exhibiting Aeneas as 0100110010 110
country. The story 01 Aeneas was probably treated in great detail
and perfect saith by Varro, from whom Servius has several quotations
of more or less importance which I have endeavoured to collect.
Varro represented the Penates, whom 10 identified with the Da' Mopsi,
00 wooden 01· marble figures brought 1] Aeneas to Italy (Serv. ou Aen.
3. 12). Originally they were carried by Dardanus from Samothrace

to Phrygia, and afterwards from Phrygia by Aeneas to Italy. Τ10
story of the Palladium (Serv. Aen. 2. 166) 000 treated by Varro 10

J much detail. According 10 110 version which he adopted, the sacred

 

 

image remained in the hands 01 Diomed, by whom it was offered to
Aeneas while the latter was passing through Calabria. Diomed 0100
gave to Aeneas the 10000 01 110 101100 Anchises (Serv. Aen. 4. 427).
Aeneas in hia wanderings was guided 1] 0 0100, Lucifer or the Stella
Veneris, which moved in 10001 01 him until he arrived at the territory
of Laurentum (Serv. Aen. l. 382). In Dodona 10 received the oracla
prophesying the famine and the eating 01 110 101100. 10 Leucas he
founded the temple 10 Venus attributed by Menander to Phaon the
Lesbian. Varro when in Epirus took note 01 110 names 01 110 places
where Aeneas had set his foot3 his list 01 names was the sameas
Virgil’s (Serv. Aen. 3. 349). He gave further details about the pro-
300] 01 110 000, whose body, as we have 0000, was shown him
preserved in brine at Lavinium (Serv. Aen. 3. 392). Anna, the
01010001 Dido, perished in the flames of her own funeral pyro for love
01 Aeneas (Serv. 01004. 682, aa). The name 01 oacrum Laurens
(Serv. Aen. 9. 8) kept np 110 memory of Aeneas’ camp near Lau-
rentum,

Thus it is clear that Varro must have brought Aeneas 10 (10011ος1.
What was his authority 100 1110 addition 10 110 current story, 00
addition 01 which there is no mention in Livy 00 1)100]0100, and
which conflicted in the most glaring manner with the commonly
received chronology,⁶ is 001 clear. It is generally assumed that
Naevius is responsible for the notion 010 meeting between Aeneas
and Did0; bnt the assumptionis based upon 01100 and 0 half of
Naevius, 110010 atque receperamus, qao paeto Troiam urbem reli-
querit, in which the subject 01 percontot is taken to be Dido. Itis
unfortunate that we cannot traca more closely the generis of the story.
Did it rest 00 0 confusion between the Carthaginien Anna and Anna
Perenna, the Italian goddess of the year? Some such 101000000 10
suggested hythe identification of the two in Ovid's Fasti.

⁶ Servius ou Aen. 4. 459, uam quod da Didone et Aenea dicitur falsum 001.
Constat enim Aeneam cccxu. anuos 0010 aedificationem Romae venisse 10 Italiam,
cum Karthago 000 0101 xa. aunis ante aedificationem Romae constructa sit.
According 1011100000, Rome aud Carthage were founded 00 tho same day.
