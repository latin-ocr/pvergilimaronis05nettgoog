AENEID. LIB. IV. 301

· Cum tacet omnis ager, pecudes pictaeque volucres, 525
Quaeque lacus late liquidos, quaeque aspera dumis
Rura tenent, somno positae sub nocte silenti
[Lenibant curas, et corda oblita laborum}

At non infelix animi Phoenissa, nec umquam

Solvitur in somnos, oculisve aut pectore noctem uso
Accipit: ingeminant curae, rursusque resurgens

Saevit amor, magnoque irarum fluctuat aestu.
