appreciated‚ carried with it its own justificatior. In the long 110010

the (1100100 Ηο100100, aud bad again and again wrested from him that
weapcn which bad so long been the terror 01 meaner ireebocters.⁸ I
heve elsewhere remarked on Virgil's absolute silence about Homer,
who, throughout the Aeneid, is never named or even indicated3 but
no 000 would interpret it aa the silence of 0 writer anxious 10 ignore
or conceal 1110 obligations. Eveu were epic narrative as 101001011Ιο 10
the introductiones personal 0011000 as pastoral dialogue or diductio
disquisition, it would have been superfluous to mention Homer in 0
poem which invites comparison with the Iliad aud Odyssey in its whole
external form, and evenin 110 very title, and contains an imitation or
translation from Homer iu almost every page.

Thia avcwed rivalry‚ Ι venture to think, should be borne in mind 10
estimating, not only the similarity 01 1110 Ηο010110 and Virgilian epioe,
bnt their discrepaucies. When we require that Virgil, drawing as he
does his characters from the circle 01 Homer-ic legend, should exhibit
- them as they are exhibited in Homer, we are not only foi-getting, what
Virgil could scarcely have iorgotten 11 110 would, the changes which
those characters underweut as they passed under the hands 01 Attio and
Alexandrian 00110010 01 000110, but we are mistaking the whole attitude
assumed by Virgil with reference 10 his illustrious prodecessor. Homer,
10 1110 eyes, is not the father 011110 01 history and 01 poetry, the sole
authority for 011 our knowledge about the Greeks and the Trojans,
their ethnology, their polity, their moral relations 10 each other; he 10
