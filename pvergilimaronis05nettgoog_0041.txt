IN TRODUGTION. xxxv

¹ we pay to the profound human interest with which Virgil's dramatis

power leads him to invest a person for whom no minstrel ot the
heroic age would have claimed a tear. Ii Virgil had been the poet

κ oi the Odyssey, it is possible that our recollections of insolence,

cruelty, and lawless sensuality would not have wholly hiudered us
from feeling for the slaughter oi the suitors.

The influence of the Greek mama is also to be observed in the
prominence given throughout the Aeneid tc female characters. Mr.
Gladstone⁸ has remarked with justice, that while Homer's women are
uniiormly feminine and retiring‚ Virgil's are slightly masculine and
generally of a pronounced type; they are agitated by violent passione
and meet with violent ends. This is ascribed hyan able critic in a
weekly journal⁶ to Virgil's experieuce of his own age, when, ior the
fisse time in Roman history, women came upon the stage of public

, liie: it is, I think, uo less (lueto the influence of the actual stage
³ of Attica. Whether or no women were admitted as spectatore of

theatrical representatione at Athens, in the stories that were repre·

, sentes they had to bear as conspicuous a part as men: the exigencies

of dramatic art required it; and perhaps the fact that their parts were
not only written but acted by men, tended still further to give them

’ ⁸ an equality which Homer would never have dreamed of, and which

Athenian life did not sanction. They are not only merged in the
aggregate oi a sympatbizing but subordinate chorus, accompanying
the action as it were with au under-song; they oocupy individually a
large portion of the mama, sometimes, like Io or Electra, as sufferers,
sometimes, like Clytaemnestra or Hecuba, as actors rising to masculine
importance. Virgil may have had actual precedente, in history or
fiction, for the characters oi Dido, Amata, J uturna, and Camilla: but
evenis hehad not, his recollectione of Greek art must have been
amply sufficient both tc suggest the thought and to gnide the pencil.
Of Virgil's more palpable and measurable obligations to the writings
oi the Greek tragedians there is less to be said. As Ι have already
intimatae, several of the plays hom which he is likely to have bor-
rowed are lost; and in the remainder the question is one rather ol
conjecture and inierence than oi direct observation. There can be no
doubt, however, that the changes which the Homeric characters
eustained in passing through the hands oi the dramatists, as well as
in the wear and tear oi common tradition, had their full effect on
Virgil’s conception of the personages who make up his gallery of the
heroic age. The appearance oi Helen in the Troades oi Euripides,

⁸ Vol. iii. p. 627. He remarks later, p. 594, on the change produced in the ‚

Homeric women when they appear as stage heroicas.
