AENEID. LIB. IV.

Marmorea referunt thalamo stratisque reponunt.

At pius Aeneas, quamquam lenire dolentem
Solando cupit et dictis evertere auras,
Multa gemens magnoque animum labefactus amore, 995
Iussa tamen dirum, exsequitur, classemque revisit.
Tum vero Teucri incumbunt et litore celsas
Deducunt toto navis. Natat uncta carina,
Frondentisque ferunt remos et robora silvis
Infabricata, fugae studio. 400
Migrantis cernas, totaque er urbe ruentis.
Ac velut ingentem formicae farris acervum Ι
Cum populant, hiemis memores, tectoque reponunt;
