xx AENEIS.

that we are reading Bucolic poems ci which line after line is to be

found in Theocritus, and precepts about husbandry which are far more
intelligibly stated in Theophrastus or in the Geoponica. It is precisely
this measure which I would wish now to extend to the Aeneid. So*
ier it may seem that Iam substantially atone with the opinion which
I heve mentioned es that which is now generally entertained on
Virgil’s claime as an spic poet. It is possible, however, thet the
, habit of sbarply contrusting the characteristica of the several works
of Virgil may have led to en exaggeration on the one side, as I believe
it has on the othon—that the Aeneid may have been brought too
exclusively to the standard of the Iliad and Odyssey, end that Virgil
may have been blamed, as Pope complains that Homer has been
blamed, for not doing what he never intended.

There can be little doubt that too much hasbeen mede of Virgil's
supposed disqualification or disinclination ior epic poetry. We heve his
own confession in the Sixth Eclogue that his early ambition was to sing
oi kings end battles: and though Phoebus may have whispered in his
ear thet snch themes were too high forone so young, so humble, and sc
unknown, we ere not obliged to conclude thet the aspiration was then
and there finally abandoned, or that as he rose naturally from short
pastorale to along diductio poem, he may not have cberished tbe hope
of rising by an equally natural ascent to a still longer epie. If Pope’s
epio poem of Aloander was the dream of his boyhood, when he fancied
himself the greatest poet that ever lived, his epic poem on Brutus was
no less the vision of his later years, when he hed corne, as he thought,
to take a just measure of his powers. That Augustus may heve exer·
cised some pressure on Virgil, urging him tc undertake heroic poetry‚
is very possible; but Virgil's words in the Third Georgic, end the
similer langnage held by other poete, such as Horace and Propertius,
would lead us to agree witha recent German editor‚⁸ that what the
emperor wished for was a direct celebraticn oi his own actions; nor
is there anything in the notices oi Suetonius⁴ to oompel us to any
other conclusion. It was only natural that Augustus should take an
interest, as we know him tc have donc, in the progress of a poem
which, in grandeur of scope and compass, promised to transcend any
previous effort of the Romanmnse, end so could not bnt reflect
indirect 'glory on his reign. We may observo, however, that in the
only words oi Virgil on the subject which have come down to us⁸ the
poet expresses himself with considerable reserva, and is by no means
forwerd to gretify the imperial curiosity. N or need we lay any stress
