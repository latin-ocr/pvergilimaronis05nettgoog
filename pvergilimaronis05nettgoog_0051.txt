8010011 has a great poet had a less promising subject 10 (1001 with
than Virgil when 110 undertoolr 10 write the Aeneid. The growth of
the Roman empire, and with it the spread of a oivihnation higher, if

we take it all in all, then any which had been previously known
in the ancient world, was indeed a fact all-important 101 the historicn
end the statesman‚ and inspiring enough to the imagination of a poet.
The problem was how 10 give poetioal form and vitelity tothe great
idea. The springs of the native Italian literature hed, in the
Augusten age, been long choked up. The Italian poete hed left
Naevius far behind them, aud went to Homer 101 their metre and
the handling 01 their subject. But instead 01 the fresh and living
creatione of the Hellenic fore-time, the Romans found, in 1110 legend
01 Aeneas, only a 111010οι mythology, the spirit 01 which was true to
nothing bnt the vanity 01 the Greek historiens who invented it. In
·the following remarks an attempt will be made 10 1111001110 origin
01 the story of Aenens' wanderings‚ and 1110 various forms which it
assumed before Virgil made it classical.

The name Αἰνείας 10 in formation parallel 10 Ἑρμείας, Αὐγείας, and
perhaps Βορέας, and would seem 10 be a patronymic from Alvos or
Αἴνη, as Αὐγείας 10 formed from Αὗγή and Ἑρμείας from Ἕρμα 01
80101110. It may be worth while 10 put together some other traces of
1110 same root which occur in the names 01 places. The mythical
founder 01 Cyzicus vves Αῑνεύς, whose nemeis another patronymic
lrom the same base; in the Troed 110011, if we may believe Strabo
(13. 1), there was a township called Αἴνεια and a river Αἴνιον. Coming
further west, we find the Thracian town Αἶνος at the mouth 01 1110
Hebrus-it is worth while in this connexion 1ο remember Strabo's

x remark that there were many names common 10 Thrace and the Troed

¹ As these 0110010 are going through the prees, an interesting essay 011 the
Legeud 01 Aeneas by M. Gaston Βο100101(110010 des mn Mendes, September 15,
1883) has come into my hands. M. Boissier, among a great number of striking
remarks, observes thet the story 01 Aeneas does not seem 10 have been illustrated
by painters or scalptore until about the time 01 VirgiL
