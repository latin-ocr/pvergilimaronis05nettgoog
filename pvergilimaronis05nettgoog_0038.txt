germ donbtless existed in the previous apic, lyric, and gnomic oom-
position3 but the drama stood distinguished from all these by
bringing it cut into conspicuous amplitude, and making it the sub·
stautive means oi effect.’' The structural exigences ci form must
-have combined with tha intellectus] temper of the time in giving
especial prominsnce to these kindred features. A dranm is shorter
than an epic; it travemae not the whole oi along history, but some
special part of it; and tha treatment oi that special part may evoka
interests conflicting with those which would be called out hythe
treatment oi the whole. Had the plot oi the Agamemnon been merged
in a longer narrative, wa should not have been led to pause on the
characteres Clytaemnestra, aud examine as we now do the ground oi
her actions. Tha institution of the trilogy, apparently contrived as a
means of taking the bearer through the various stages of a lengthened
story, was frequently made to be diractly subserviant to this ccuflict
oi inter-ests, the first and second plays complicating a knot which it
was the business of the third to unravel. N c more striking instance
of this can have existed than that furnished to us hythe chance
which hus robbed ns of the first and third plays of the Promethean
trilogy and preserved the second. The grounds oi Zeus's vengsance ,
are not set before ns as clearly as they donbtless were in the opening
drama, nor have we more than the faintest glimpses oi the terms oi
- reconciliation which were ratified iu the third; wa simply see the
Titan in the first agony of his suffering, we feel his wrongs, we hear
oi his good deeds, we witness a display of his prophetie power, and
our sympathies are wholly on his side. Accident has allowed us to
hear but one part oi the summing up, and we mistake it, as medem
writers of genius have mistaken it, for a piace oi powerful advocacy.
As the Greek drama advanced, its rhetorical and dialectical aspecta
became still more apparent. The chorus, gradually divested of its
musical glories, yet compelled as a general rnle to continue on the
stage, becomes a mere moderator between disputante, interposing a
couplet of common-place at the end of the animated orations in which
the various parties &vocate their competing riews.

Itis needless to dwell on the profound intellectual effect which
suche species of composition was calculated to produce. Many
modern readers will heva experienced the same stimulus in reading
contemporary works of ficticn; they will vividly remember the time
when they came to be interested, not so much iu unexpected incidente
or a skiliully constructed plot, as in tha evolntion of character, and
the statement or solution ci some complex moral problem. Not
without a considerable sacrifice oi beauty oi form, the modern prose
fiction combiues the depth of tragedy with the breadth oi epic poetry‚
