Aeneas iu Aen. 6. 525. If Welcker is right (Ep. Cycl. 2 p. 235) in
saying that the werke of Arotinus appear to have been the most
considerable among the poems ot the Trojan cycle, alter the Iliad and
Odyssey, Virgil may be supposed to heve followed him 'from poetical
pmference.

Ilium the story of the capture of Tmy, and 11ιοἸλιᾶςμκράοί
Isesches Virgil does not seem to have horrowed much. Indeed‚ in
details, as far as our evidence goes, he seems to have followed au
altogether different tradition from that which Lesches adopted.
Lesehes represented the murder of Priam us occurring not at the'
altar ot Ζεὺς ἕρκειος, but et the door of his palace3 he made Aeneas'
wife not Creusa, but Eurydice, and he gave Aeneas himself as a
captive to Neoptolemus (Welcker 1. c. p. 538). Pausanias (10. 25
foll.) describes some pictures oi the night-battle in Troy, painted at
Delphi by Polygnotus, who, he thinks, followed the account given
by [lesches. The details oi these pictures cannot be brought into
harmony with Virgil’s account of the'night-bettle in the second
,Aeneid nor do the names oi the combatants, as a mle, occur in them‘. ·
The love ol Coroebus for Cassandra, is however mentioued (10. 27. 1).

Whether, when wn'ting the sixth Aeneia Virgil was at all in-
fluencedby the account ot Hodes and its terrore, which, according to
Pausanias (10. 28. 4), was contained in the Μινυάς and the Νόστοι, ⁸
cannot be ascertained.-[H. N.]
