with which we have had to content ourselves till now, not only in
degree but in kind, and that their use is likely to effect a con-
siderable change even iu that text of Virgil which, since the time
ol Nicholas Heinsius, has been generally accepted as the best. ψ

That text indeed has now but little to fear from the competition ’

of the text or texts which it superseded: the authority which
they were supposed to derive from the Palatino has disappeared
ior ever now that that copy hasbeen actually examined, and
their real support is apparently to be found in most cases partly
in copies of no name or weight, partly perhaps in the arbitrary
conjectures of early editors. But the testimony of the Medicean,
on which Heinsius chiefly rested, has beeu considerably wealrened
by the results ot* the new collatione: in very many instances the
other uncial MSS. are seen to be arrayed against it, while its ’
readings may not unfrcquently be accounted for by the paral-

lelism of other passages in Virgil, which the transcriber appa-
rently remembered. Probably however it is promoturo as yet to

decide on the whole question: we shall leam the real value of
our newly collated MSS. better as we become used to them, and
, there may be adaugeret accepting novelties ol reading simply
³ as novelties—a danger which Ι seem to see exemplified in Rib-
beek’s text, and which my readers will perhaps find to be
exemplified in mine. The general result certainly confirms what
Ι ventured to essert in my former Prcface, both as to the existence
of many varieties of reading which can hardly be accounted for
on palaeographical or other external grounds, and which must
often be estimated by the somewhat wavering measurement of
individual preference, and as to the sufficiency of a text made
up from one or other of the MSS. or early authorities without
Ι critical conjecture. In the more important of the two instances
in the Eclegues where, following others, I had ventured to depart
from the MSS.,I have now learnt from Lachmann and Madvig
that no change was necessary: and if there are any places in the
present volume where a word has been introduced from the
dictum of a critic without some ancient authority, it will be
