INTRODUO'I'ION. xxv

pcrtiny it ae a contest oi fraud and crnelty with heroic eudnrance
aad genuine bravery; ibey could poise the event mors doubtfully in
the balance, and call down indignatiou on tbs crimes that stained the
hour of triumph; they could point to the retribution which fell, even
within the period cf the legend, ou the homes of those who had made
othere homelese, and ehadow forth in prophetie vision the yet more
terrible recompensa which history was to bring in the fulneee oi time.
Aeneae ie drawn by Homer at a time when, from the naturaei the
esee, he could only play a secondary part in the action; yet Homer
admits his reputation among hie countrymen, and grudgingly concedes
his real prowees, while hs makes the 'l'rojan hero’s future the special
concern oi destiny, provided for evan by those gods who are the fiercest
eremias of Troy. virgil takes up his story when he is leit alone as
the oue eurviving protector of his country, the fcrlorn hope of those
who sought to reciet, during tha sack of the city, the recognized leader
of the Trojan migration. Woreted ae hc had been by Achilles, and
even by Diomed, it wne no lese true that he had men a terror to the
loide of the Danaane aud the armies oi Agamemnon, nor was there
⁸115 reason why he and hie 'lhojane should not prove too strong for
the Italian untione, though they had pruved too weak for the forces cf
Graece. Even in Homer it ie easy to see that the character of Ulysses
has more sides than one: heis the prinae ol policy, because with him
every species of fraud is lawfu13 and it ie natural that his stratageme
should be differently estimated by those in whose favour they are
audead and those to whom they brought havoc, exile, and death.
Virgil, it ie bue, represents hie Ulysecs as engagiug in crimes irum
which the Homeric Ulyssee would probably bave ehrunk3 but we must
not judge a poet ae we should judge a bietcrian who were to invent
actone in order io support a preconceived theory of character. If
the right oi independeut treatment be conceded, it must be allowed tc
extend, not only to the interpretation oi character, but tc the invention
oimmdent. Regarding Homer ae a party chronicler, Virgil was not
mund to assume that he hae recorded all the actions oi bis hero, any
more thau that hs hee given a true colour to those actions which he
hae recorded and eo tbe poet of Troy, having taken such a measure
ae it was in the nature oi a 'lh-ojau to take oi '1¹roy's subtlest enemy,
night fairly avail himself oi any poetHcmerie tradition which might
fletvs the cause that he had to advocate, or even create ior himself
uetmffirione, so long ae they were plausible and consistent. “Aut
famam sequere, ant eibi convenientia finge.¹’ To be plausible aud
wmietent are a pcet's sole histor-ica] dutiee; aud in thie instance
plausibility and consistency are to be estimated‚ not according to the
view which sets up Homer as the one record of historical cuth, bul
