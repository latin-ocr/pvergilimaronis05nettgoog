horse, and sc the serpente are sent ιο destroy his children by his side. Cassandra
then takes his place in denunciation, but is gihed at by the Trojans: she tries her·
seli ιο burn cr break open the horse,but torah and weapons arewrested from her. Α
paragraph is spent in eniorcing the statement that the Greeks suffered during the
sack as well as the Trojano, aad the modes cf their deaths are enumerated with
stetistical particularity. Some, we are told, were hit by goblets, othere by tables,
others by tcrches and spite with meat adhering tc them, others by hatchets: some
have their tingere cut off in trying ιο ward off blows: some are hrnised with stenes,
and some pierced with lances, which the Trojans were able ιο wield in spite of the
wine they had drunk. We are told cf Aeneas' escape, which it appears was owing
partly, as in Virgil, to the protection of his mother, who warded off the weapons of
the enemy, but partly also ιο a speech ot Galchas ιο the Greeks, ordering them ιο
spare him cn account of his signal piety in taking his father and scu with him
rather than his treasnre. But perhaps the greatest piace cf fletaess is found in
Pyrrhus’ speech to old Prien, who hae been praying for death at his hands :-

ὃγέρον, ἐμμεμαῶτα real deotpertum ἀνώγοι·
οὗ yde α’ ἐχθρὸν ἐόντα μετὰ ζωοῖσιν ἐείσω·
ot γάρ τι ψυχῆς πέλει ἀνδράσι φίλτερον ἄλλο.

'l'ryphiodorns is a writer cf a somewhat lower stamp, perhaps eqcal in power ιο
Smyrnaeus, but inferior in teste and judgment. He concentrates himself chiefly on
the wooden horse and the events immediately connected with it, fifty linas being
given tc a minute description of all its parts, from which it appears that it was a
eostly as well as elaborate perimmensa-its eyes being made cf beryl and amethysti,
and its teeth of silver. Ulysses‚ as ln Smyrnaeus, lays down the programme cf
operatione: the heroes riso one after another, as at the challenge cf Hector in the
seventh book of the Iliad, aad volunteer in the service: and when they are lodged
in the horse, Pallas provides them with ambrosia: immediately atter which.they
are aptly compared ιο beasts running down a roclr ιο escape a winter torrent, and
waiting in their den, famiehed with hunger. Sinon is left, mangled, like Ulysaes in
Helen’s story in the fourth Odyssey, with stripes from hie own hand, and tells a
similar story ιο that in Virgil, except that he represents himself as having been
soourged by his comrades because he refused ιο fly with them. The dragging cf the
horse into the city is detailed at tedicus length-the agency cf the gods, which dnly
appears later in the poem, being testelesely anticipated, and Here being made to
open the gates wider than usual, while Poseidon knooks down part ot the stonework
of the entrance. Cassandra protecta, as in Smyrnaeus, and is severely npbraided hy
her father, who sends her ιο her chamber. Helen's story in Homer is again put
under requisition, und the adulteress is made to address the Greeks within the horse
in the tenes of their respective wives; bnt the incident is an isoluted one, and no
attempt is made to harmoniae it with the rest citha story. For the rest cf the book
the narrative proceeds more rapidly‚ the different events cf the sack being de·
spatched each in a few lines, without any attempt at pictoris] narrative The poet
cannot, he says, tell all that happened on that night: that is a business for the
Muses: he ieels himself ιο he a chariat-driver nearing the goel. Tsetses need
hardly detain us a moment, aa his narrative of the sack oi Troy is utterly contemp-
tible, with no preteneion ιο poetry, and very little to style cr metra. He is tortu·
nately briei, and in fact presente a condeneed rdsumt cf the story as told by his
various predecessore, Virgil included, the absence cf detail enabling him in general
to avoid the points in which they differ. There is however quite enough to distin-
guish him from them, or trem any other writer professing to be a poet. When the
herces get into the horse, he takes the opportunity of telling ns the persensi charac-
teristica of the leading Greeks in lines like these :-
