mss voice oi criticism hos unanimously tired on this book, along with the Fonrth
and suth, as affording the best evidence ot the truc greatness ot' Virgil. Whether
or no we believe tho story told in Suetonius’ biography, that the poet himself chose
these three books to read tc Augustus es a specimen of his work, it indicates at any
rate the judgment passed hy antiquity; and modern opinion has not been slow to
ratiiy the verdict.

The conception of the present book is eminently fortunate. Homer has made
Ulysses tell the story ot' his wanderings to Alcinous, and so hed supplied the canvas
on which the younger artist might work: bnt the tale of Troy taken t'orms no port oi
the narrative ot the Odyssey: it is briefly sung by a hard, whose strsins move the
tears ci Ulysses, as the Trojan perimite at Carthago hed mcved those of Aeneas: bnt
that is all. It was open to virgil to make his hero tell the whole story oi the dc·
structiones Troy without trespussing on Homer’s gronnd; and he seized the oppor-
tunity. The subject could not fail to be most impressive‚ and it is introduced with
perfect propriety. Dido, it is true, knew the main incidente of the siege; but thet ·
was all the more resson why she should wish to hear them from the chief living
witness on the side ot' Troy. Virgil too has shown his wisdom not only in what he
has said, but in whet he has left unsaid. Dido's curiosity would noturally extend
over the whole ten years; but the poet knew thet a detail of the siege, natursl as it
might be, would weary his readers. He tells us that the queen asked of Priom and
Hector, ct Diomcd and Achilles: but he does not require us tc listen to Aeneas till
he con concontrate our attention cn ‘ the last agony of Troy‚’ the one night in which
the city vves taken and sacked.

The taking ot Troy was, as might be expected, a iavourite sanect with poete
before Virgil. It t'ormed pert of the epic cycle; it was hosted by the masters cf the
Ι Greek drama Ol these works the only one that hos come down to us is the Tmcdes
ot Euripiden end even that hes its soene laid atter the catastrophe. which it deals
with only by way ol retrospect.⁴ We know enough of the others to be essured that
the mein incidente in Virgil's narrative—the story ot the Trojan horse, the introduc·
tion of Sinon, the tregic death of Laocoon—ere taken from his predecessore it
would have been unnatnral ii it had not been so. Custom bound Virgil to follow
the legend in its main bearings es he hed received it, though it leit him quite free,
as 1 have contended in the general Introduction to the Aeneid, to very minor details,
and give his own colonr tc the whole. How tar Virgil is original in the minuties
oi his treatment, we cannot tell. Macrobius indeed makes one ot his interlocutors
(Set 5. 2) speak ot it as a lect known to every schoclboy, thot the story ot this book
is taken almost word ior word srom one Pisender, who wrote amythologioal history
oi the world in verse; but though the charge is circumstantielly made, it is dis·
