little I profess 10 approach the ideal which the nature 01 my work
keeps 01 necessity continually before my mind. Virgil interests
me chiefly because he is a Latin poet: asa student 01 poetry, I take

delight in tracing, word by word, his delicate intricacies 01 expres·
sion, which stimulate curiosity while they baffle analysis, as well
as in endeavouring to appreciata 1110 broader features 01 his work

as a whole and its place in the history 01 literature: as a student Ι

01 Latin, I am interested in comparing his language with that of
his predecessore and successors, and in' observing the light which
his use 01 his native tangue throws on the various unselved or
half-solved problema in Latin grammar. Other questions, what-
ever may be their relative importance 10 the scholar, I have ven·
tured to regard as subordinate: they appear to me 10 be less
immediately connected with the interpretation 01 Virgil, as they
certainly have less aflinity to my own testes and the course 01 my
studies I bave not neglected them: when they have crossed my
path, as they have in almost every page, I have sought 10 obtain
the requisita information about them: bnt I have generally been
content to trust the knowledge which has been accumulated by

others without trying to add 10 it, or indeed affecting to 101111 011 ‹

Since this work was first undertaken, the criticism 01 the text
01 Virgil has been placed ona new basis by the publication 01
Ribbeck’s edition. Previously‚ though we had 1000110011110
readings 01 0 great variety 01 copies, we were unhappily without
accurate collatioris 01 several 01 the most important; in the case
indeed 01 0110 01 them, the Palatina, we seem to have been with·
out a collation at all. We now possess collatioris 01 011 the uncial
MSS„ fragmentary and entire, and 01 four or five 01 the most
important 011110 cursives, which 101 minute and painstaking
accuraoy apparently leave but little to desire: and great care has
been taken not only in collecting 1110 testimonias 01 the different
grammarisns who quote passages 110111 Virgil, but in noting the
readings 01 the various MSS. 01 each witness. There can be no
doubt that our present critical materiale surpsss 11100101 those
