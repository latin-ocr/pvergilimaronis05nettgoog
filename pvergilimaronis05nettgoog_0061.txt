1 THE STORY OF AENEAS’ WANDERINGS. lv

a place in the territory of Laurentum called Troia where Aeneas
was supposed to have lauded: so Festus testifies, aud other authorities.
Servius on Aen. 9. 9, hooc (lacteam Laurens ait dici Varro, oppidum
tacet. Sed ahi minam Aeaeos eyrasos at, eam locam Troiam aocca-
³ pari traditur. Aproeda'cm Troiomcnin the neighbourhood of Antium
ismeutioned by Cicero (Att. 9. 13. 6); Festus mentions a occupas
Tmmeritcs, whence the tritos Tromeottco. Thoactes was theold name
of a knighc, and Troia (not ladas Troiae) that of the well-known
cavalry tournament. Whatever the ultimate origin aud the meaning
of the base from which all these words are derived, aud on this point
I offer no opinion, there seems little doubt that Troia aud its cognatos
are genuine Italian words. And if so, especially as there were
remains oi a large ancient enoampment near Lauro-Lavinium (Serv.
on Aen. 7. 32), what fact could be more welcome to a, Greek dealer
in cheap mythology thau the. appearance of the name Troia on
Italian grouud; what fact easier to combine with the rest of the

1 Italian legend? Livy 1. 1. 23 says that Troia was also the name of
y the place where Antenor lauded among the Veneti. Was the name

there, es iu Latium, the startingpoint aud support of the legend?
Another Italian feature, upon which all the recent scholare,
Klausen, Schwegler, and Preller, have already commented, is the
story ol the eatiug of the tables3 this, in the eclwlio attributed to
Servius, is rightly referred to the messae puniceae of Roman worship.
The Latin Penates was easily identified with the θεοὶ, μεγάλοι of
Samothrace, associated, as we have seen, with the worship of Ἀφροδίτη
Alceste. There was a temple of Venus at Antium (Pliu. 3. 57) and
at Lavinium (Strabo 5. 3). The latter was probably the Venus
Fratic to whom according to Cassius Hemina (ap. Soliu. 2. 14)
Aeneas dedicated the image which he had brought from Sicily. I
see no reason ior identilying the word Fontis with the Greek
Ἀφροδίτῃ why should it not be agenuine Italian name? Finally,
Aeneas himself was made oue with the Iuppiter Iodiyes of the country.
It is worth observing that in its main outline the story of the
iomanes of Aeneas after landing iu Italy somewhat resembles that of
the founding of Troy by Teucer as given by Servius on Aen. 3. 108.
Servius mentions two versione ol the legend, one that Scamander,
driven by a famine from Crete, migrated to Phrygia, aud atter con·
quering the neighbouring Bebrycians iu battle disappcared in the
river Xanthus: victor io Xantho flamine lapsas noa comparuit. So the
