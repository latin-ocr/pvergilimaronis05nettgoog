THE STORY OF AENEAS’ WANDERINGS. xlix

nected Italy with the wandering heroes who vvere secking homes after
the destruction of Troy. Thus Diomed and Ulysses were brought

to the shores of the western seas, and those legende grew up to which
laudor in his ‘⁴ Helleuics ” has succeeded so well in giving a poetical
form aud interest. The stories of the Trojans Aeneas and Antenor
¹ coming to these regions may douhtless be readily connected with the

cyclo of Hellenio myths. It seems now to be doubted² whether any
distinct allusion to Aeneas' Italian voyage can be elicited from the
supposed quotation from Stesichorus in the Ilian table, which
’ mentions Aeneas as starting for Hesperia. According to Pliny (3. 57)
Theophrastus was the first Greek who wrote with any care on Roman
affairs. Before Theophrastus the notion had arisen that Rome had
been founded by Aeneas in the company of Ulysses. Dionysius
(l. 72) quotes as his authority ior this statement the list of priestesses
in Argos. The compilor of these lists is assumed³ by Miiller in his

ngments of the Greek historiens to have been Hellanicus. In a
story little varying from the former Aristotle asserted that Rome

’ was founded by certain Ἀχαιοί, who on their return from Troy were

caught in a storm as they vvere rounding Cape Malea, and vvere at
length carried by the violence of the wind to the coast of Latium.

¹ Here they spent the winter, intending to sail with the spring. But

some captive women whom they had brought from Troy, anxious to
escape the slavery which awaited them in Greece, toolr the opportunity
one night of burning the ships, and making further progress im·
possible. The name Ῥώμη was that of the Trojan woman by whose
advice this measure was taken. This is the story adopted by Hera·
clides lembus, the historiar of the time of Antiochus Epiphanes:
(Fest. p. 268 Miller, and Solinus 1. 2) Heraclidi placet, Troia capta
quosdam ee Achiuis e'u ea loco obi nunc Rornc est dweuuse per Tiberim,
deinde euadente Rome nobilissimo captivarum quae hie comcs erat,
inemo nuestus paschae sedes, instrue-isse croceio, et oppidum ab eo
&meu euocasse. He mentions another version: Apotlrooles scribit
, Moero aon captiuum fuisse at supro dietum eat, sed Asconio notum
Aeaeae neptem appellationis istius oausam fuisse. In the same spirit
the historian Xenagoras made Ulysses and Circe the parents of Romus,
Antias, and Ardeae, and Gallias, who wrote the history of Agathocles,
mede Romulus and Remus the sons of Latinus and a Trojan woman
named Rome. The story of the women burning the ships was after·
warda transferred to the Trojan fleet, which according to one version

⁸ Yet this is diffloult to accept, lor Dionysius is carelul to mention Hellanicus
by name in ohap. 48, and there seems to be no reason why he should not have done

l so, had hs besu alluding to him, in ohap. 72.
