lviii THE STORY OF AENEAS’ WANDERINGS.

Let us now briefly examine the account adopted or invented by
Virgil, and compare it with the tradition followed by Livy and
Dionysiae.

The stages oi Aeneas’ wanderings as given by Dionysius are as
follows z—From Troy he goes to Pallene, where he leaves some of his
sick and weakly followers3 thence to Delos, thence to Cythera, thence
to Zacynthus, where, owing to old ties of blood, he is kindly received.
Here Aeneae institutes a gymnastio contest for the youth, which is
still kept up. Thence he pasees on to Leucas, Actium, Ambracia3
from Ambracia Anchises goes to Buthrotum and Aeneas to Dodona,
where he meets Helenus and the Trojans with him; next to Italy,
where a contingent was left to form a settlement on the Iapygiau
promontory. Meanwhile Aeneas sails to Sicily, where he founds
,Elymus and Segesta, and leaves part of his own following, and thence
to Italy, where he lande successively at Palinurus, at Leucosia, at
Misenum, at Caieta, and at laurentum.

Ilivy‘s account is, compared with this, a mere abridgment. He
makes only two stages between Troy and Italy, namely Macedonia
and Sicily. Virgil must apparently have drawn upon the same
sources as Dionysius, though he varies the details, and (in the case
of Carthago) makes an addition oi which the historiens know nothing.
Thrace, Delos, Leucas, Buthrotum, Sicily, appear both in the narrative
ol Dionysius and iu the third Aeneid3 Virgil adds Crete and the
Strophades. The story of the burning of the ships by the Trojan
women, which we have seen to be as old es Aristotle, is localized by
Virgil in Sicily. Dionysius mentions gemes instituted by Aeneas at
Zacynthus3 of these Virgil knows nothing, but devotas a whole book
to gemes celebrated in Sicily in honour ol Anchises, who according to
his account had died at Drepanum.

Virgil rightly seiaed upon the fact that Sicily was the contre of the
story of Aeneas. Legenda of a Trajan settlement there hod been
alive since the fifth century no, and, what was more important for
Virgil’s poetical purpose, Sicily was the maeting-point ot Rome and
Carthago. The great idea which inspires the first part of the Aeneid
the idea with which the poem opens, is that ol bringing Rome and
Carthago into a mythical connexion. The authority whom Virgil

immediately followed in the matter Ι suspect to have beon Varro, ⁴

who, as we have seen, represented Anna the sister of Dido as perishing y
in the flames for love oi Aeneas. That Virgil drew largely upon the
stores of antiquarian information collected by Varro may be taken as
morally certain; his view of the Penates is essentislly that of Varro;

aad other features of the legend, as Aeneas’ presence in Iaeucas and ,

his following the prodigy of the white sow, were, as we have seen,
emphasiaed by Varro iu great detail.
