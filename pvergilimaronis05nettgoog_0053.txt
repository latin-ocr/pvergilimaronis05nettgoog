THE STORY OF AENEAS’ WANDERINGS. xlvii

ν patronymic, it may also be observed that Asconius, Accowia, Αεεαηίαε,
and meantum are names of a city in Aetolia, of a lake near Nicaea, oi
au island among the Sporades, of a district (ἲ) in Bithynia, and of some
islanda off the coast of the Troad. The names, therefore, both of
Aeneas and his son are closely connected with names of places ; indeed,
it does not appear that Ascanius is the son of Aeneas in any poet
earlier than Stesichorus. .

Aeneas in the Homeric poema is the son of Aphrodite, the heaven·
protected, heaven-favoured hero whose race is to endure and to rule
π after that of Priam is destroyed. A family of Aeneadae retained, at
Scepsis in the Troad, a memoryoi their bygone royalty in certa-iu
functione, perhaps priestly, which they were for long allowed to exer·
cisa (Strabo, 13‚1). Ido not venture to offer any opinion as tothe
actual relation which these Aeneadae bore tc the Aeneas oi the Iliad;
¹ or to decide whether or no the Homeric hero is merely a name, in-
vented to account for the existence of the royal and priestly family,
¹ aronnd which the subseqnent storias of his wanderings grew up step
by step. ButIthinkthat we must in any caseatart from the names
of the places with which Aeneas was said to have been connected. If
we may trust Dionysius (l. 48), the legenda which dealt with the fate
v oi Aeneas after the capture oi Troy were various end irreconcilable.
Menecrates oi Xanthus represented him as having betrayed Troy to
the Greeks, others said'that he was sent into Phrygia by Priam ou
some military service. And the storias which represented him as
’ leaving the city of his fathers did not agree how far he wandered,
³ Hegesianax, and Hegesippns the historian oi Pallene, bringing him
only as far as that peninsula, while others made him leave Thrace and
go on as far as Arcadia, where he founded a city which was named
Caphyae after the Trojan Capys. Remembering the Thracian city
Aenus, and the Pallenian Aeneia, we need find no difficulty, considering
the contradictory and untmstworthy character of these stories, in
attributing the idea ot Aeneas' presence in those places, which is
apparently aa old ae Lesches, solely to their names; nor need the con-
nexion of the Arcadian Gaphyae with the Trojan Capys give us any
more trouble than the reference oi the Italian name Capua to the
same hero. It may be added that according to Pausaniae (8. 12. 8)
there was also in mosea a mountain called Ancharia with a graveas
Anchises.

Before going into the question cf Aeneas' voyage to Italy, it will be
aa well to consider the remaining traces of the legende which brought
him into various parts oi Hellae. Dionysius (1. 50) asseres us that
there were many signs oi the presence oi Aeneas in Delos, whither
Aeneas came while the island was gavarred by King Anius. Delos
