ermour es his own; in the other cese it is e despot‚ who walks through
the houses oi his subjecte, and takes eway snything thet strikes his
fancy, ior the edornmcnt ot his own pelece. Almost ull thet we know
oi the ectuel obligations oi Virgil to the Punic Wer of Nervius, is
thet in Naevins' poem, no less than in Virgil’s, Aenees is supposed to
he questioned about his departure from Troy, thet Naevius epeelrs oi
Dido end her sister Anne, from which it is inierred thet the questioner
of Aeneas is the Carthaginien queen, and that the consolation eddressed
by Aeneas to his crew in the First Aeneid end the discourse between
Venus end Jupiter in the seme book ere, as waere told in words
which must necessarily be understood with some latitude‚¹ ‘ entirely ’
tehen from the old poet. It must be confessed thet the two or three
lines quoted by Servius in exemplification ot the hints which Naevius
geva to Virgil do not suggest the notion oi eny very close imitation.

’ When N sevius seys oi the wives of Anchises end Aenees-

“ Amborum uxores
Noctu 'Proied exibent capitibus opertis
Flentes embee abeuntes leorimis oum multis,’'

we are not obliged to think thet but ior them Virgil could not heve
Wssilflss ‘¹ Litore cum petrice leerimens portusque relinquo
lit compos ubipi'roie luit.” ⁸

And we feel thet the Virgilian Aeneas might heve represented himself

¹ es ‘wondering et the multitude ’ ⁴ oi those who followed his fortunes

‘animis opibusque pereti‚’ even it Naevius, speaking oi thesemo
gethering, had not specified the three points of numbers, ‘eorum sectam
sequontur multi mortales,’ brevery, ‘multi alii e Trois strenui viri‚'
and wealth, ‘uhi foras cnm auro illi exibent.'⁶ Nor is it likely thet the
Saturnian measure, ‘the berherous utterence oi wood-gods end berds‚’
