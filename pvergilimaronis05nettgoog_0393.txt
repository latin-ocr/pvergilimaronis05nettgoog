AENEID. LIB. IV. 319

Conscendit furibunda rogos, ensemque recludit
Dardanium, non hos quaesitum munus in 0000.

Hic, postquam Iliacas vestes notumque cubile
Conspexit, paulum lacrimis et mente morata,
Incubuitque toro, dixitque novissima verba: 650
Dulees exuviae, dum fata deusque sinebat,

Accipite hanc animam, meque his exsolvite euris.

Vixi, et, quem dederat cursum fortuna, peregi ;

Et nunc magna mei sub terras ibit image.
