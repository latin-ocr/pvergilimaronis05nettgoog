AENEID. LIB. L

Incubuere mari, totumque a sedibus imis

Una Eurusque Notusque ruunt creberque procellis 85
Africus, et uastos volvunt ad litora ductus

Insequitur clamorque virum stridorque rudentum.
Eripiunt subito nubes caelumque diemque

Teucrorum ex oculis; ponto nox incubat atra

Intonuere poli, et crebris micat ignibus aether, 90
Praesentemque viris intentant omnia mortem.

Extemplo Aeneae solvuntur frigore membra;

Ingemit, et duplicis tendens ad sidera palmas

Talia voce refert: Ο terque quaterque beati,

Quis ante ora patrum Troiae sub moenibus altis 95
