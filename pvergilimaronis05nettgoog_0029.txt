INTRODUOTION. xxiii»

adranced in my Introduction to the Eclogues. The diversityis a
more complex question, and may well oceupy us somcwhat longer.
The productiori ot the Aeneid was part of that general burst oi
literar-y enthusiasm which distinguishes the Augustan period. Roman
literature had always been imitative; Pacuvius and Attius had set
themselves to make the best they could out of Sophocles and Aes·
chylus;² and it was doubtless in his own judgment‚ as well as in that
of eulogistic critias, that Ennius appeared to be wisc and bravo, and a
meond Homer.⁸ But the period which witnessed the establishment oi
the empire generated new hopes and aspiratione among the poets of
Rome. The fervonr of an age, half revolutionury‚ half organie in its
character, had produced intellectual activities which the imperial
system was not slow to welcome and chen'sh. The writers of the new
era saw that Grecos had as yet yielded but few of her spoils to her
semi-barbarous invaders3 and they planned fresh expeditione, which
should bc undertakcn under more exaltcd auspices, and return crowned
with greener and more luxuriant laurels. The ebullition of anticipatcd
triumph which opens the Third Georgia doubtless represents the real
feeling of the poet, though the vision which he there professes to see
does not correspond in its details with that which his better genius
afterwards rcvealed to him. Graece was to bc conquercd, and con-
quered with her own weapous. The gemes were to be the verit·
able Olympio gemes, transplanted to the banks ot the Mincio, those

gemes of which the racc and the caestus are the typc; and the cere· ’

triumph. It was in this spirit that hc addressed himself to the taslr

tobc avoided or dexteronsly concealed, but to bc openly and boldly
embraced3 audit was the hitherto unapproaehed excellence ot the
model which was held to constitute the glory ot the success. Evcn in
his own day there appear to have been critics, probably rival versificrs,
who reproached him with having taken so much from Homer3 and
the answer which he ia said to have made shows the light in which hs
wished his own labours to be regarded.⁴ “laet them try to steal for
