lii THE STORY OF ¹AENEAS’ WANDERINGS.

nen tam oh recentia alle meiito quam originis memmio (Livy 38. 39.
10). By the end of the third or the beginning of the second century
ao. the Romans are recognized as Aeneadae in the eyes of the world.
In Rome Troy has conquered her ancient enemy3 Aeneae toec de
Danais victoribus arina.

Itis therefore unnecessary to speak of the later Greek historiens,
of Lycophron, and of the Sibyllina eracles, and we may pass on to
consider the next phase in the development of the story.

Hitherto the legend had been formed and used in an anti-Hellenie
sense3 it was different, however, in the last century of the republie,
after Graece had finally caused to bean enemy of Roma and when the
Romans had come to regard Greek culture as the ‚main element in
their future mental development. The loss of the bnlk of Varro’s
workS, and ofmuch other intermediate literature, rendere it impossible
for us to traca the growth of that change in the complexion of our
legend which is so patent and so complete in the peges of Dionysius.
This writer is at the greatest paine to prove the trnth of Aeneas’
arrival in Italy. He quotes many Greek and all the Roman historiens
on his side, besides a number of eracles, Sibyllina and Delphis, and
other tokens in the shape of local rites and religione traditione. To
the dengerous rationalism which suggested that Aeneas could not have
died eud been buried in more places than one, and yet that there were
many supposed tombs of Aeneas, he replies (1. 54) that this difficulty
occurs iu the case of many illustrious men, and is easily to be explained
by the consideration that though their bodies can only be in one place,
it is possible for their memorias to be enshriued in several. But
Dionysius is not only jealous for the trnth of his story; he has also
his own reading of its signification. To him the Trojans are Hellenos,
the Greeks Ἀχαιοί. Aeneas in his answer to Iratinns (1. 58) says,
“We are Trojans hy rece, and were citizens of a city which wasone
of the most conspicuous among the Hellenes3 of this we have been
deprived, after a ten years’ war, hy the Achaeans,'' and so forth.
latinns enswers that on his part he is friendly to the whole Hellenic
rece. The proof of this connexion, for the trnth of which Dionysius
refers generally to old authorities (1. 61), is rested on the Arcadian
origin of the Trojans. The genealogy is as follows :—

Zeus = Electra

Dardanus = Bateia

Zacynthus Erichthonius

Aeneas

the same ss that given in verse by Virgil, Aen. 8. 134 foll.
