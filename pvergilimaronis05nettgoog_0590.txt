516 P. VERGILI MARONIS

Vicit iter durum pietas? datur ora tueri,
Nate, tua, et notas audire et reddere voces ?
Sic equidem ducebam animo rebarque futurum, tau
Tempora dinumerans, nee me mea cura fefellit.
. Quas ego te terras et quanta per aequora vectum
Accipio! quantis iactatum, nate, periclis! -
Quam metui, ne quid Libyae tibi regna nocerent!
Ille autem: Tua me, genitor, tua tristis imago, 695
Saepius occurrens, haec limina tendere adegit;
Stant sale Tyrrheno classes. Da iungere dextram,
Da, genitor, teque amplexu ne subtrahe nostro,
Sic memorans largo fletu simul ora rigabat.
