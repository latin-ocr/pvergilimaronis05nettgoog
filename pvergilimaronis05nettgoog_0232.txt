158 P. VERGILI MARONIS

Iam pridem invisus divis et inutilis annos

Demoror, ex quo me divom peteretque hominnm rex
Fulminis adflavit ventis et contigit igni.

Talia perstabat memorans, fixusque manebat. 610
Nos contra effusi lacrimis coniunxque Creusa
Ascaniusque omnisque domus, ne vertere secum

Cuncta pater fatoque urguenti incumbens vellet.
Abnegat, inceptoque et sedibus haeretis isdem.
