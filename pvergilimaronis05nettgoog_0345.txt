acrimonia. iv. 271

Incenditque animum dictis atque aggerat iras. ¹

Hic Hammone satus, rapta Garamantide Nympha,
Templa Iovi centum latis inmania regnis,
Centum aras posuit, vigilemque sacraverat ignem, aoo
Excubiae divum aeternas, pecudumque cruore
Pingue solum et variis florentia limina sertis.
Isque amens animi et rumore accensus amaro
Dicitur ante aras media inter numina divom
Multa Iovem manibus supplex orasse supinis: 111
Iuppiter omnipotens, cui nunc Maurusia pictis
Gens epulata toris Lenaeum libat honorem,
Aspicis haec? an te, genitor, cum fulmina torques,
Nequiquam horremus, caecique in nubibus ignes
