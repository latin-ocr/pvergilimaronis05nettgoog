AENEID. LIB. V. ,

· Et Nox atra polum bigis subvecta tenebat:
Visa dehine eaelo facies delapsa parentis
Anchisae subito talis effundere voees:
Nate, mihi vita quondam, dum vita manebat,
Care magis, nate, Iliacis exercite fatis, 725
Imperio Iovis huo venio, qui elassibus ignem ’
Depulit, et eaelo tandem miseratus eb alto est.
Consiliis pare, quae nuno pulcherrima Nautes
Dat senior3 leotos iuvenes, fortissima corda,
Defer in Italiam; gens dura atque aspere cultu 730
Debellanda tibi Latio est. Ditis tomen ante
