P. VERGILI MARONIS

Per tot ducta viros antiqua ab origine gentis.

Aeneas, neque enim patrius consistere mentem
Passus amor, rapidum ad navis praemittit Achaten,
Ascanio ferat haec, ipsumque ad moenia ducat. 645
Omnis in Ascanio cori stat cura parentis.

Munera praeterea, Iliacis erepta ruinis,

Ferre iubet, pallam signis auroque rigentem,

Et circumtextum croceo velamen acantho,

Ornatus Argivae Helenae, quasilla Mycenis, oto
Pergama cum peteret inconcessosque Hymenaeos,
Extulerat, matris Ledae mirabile donum:
