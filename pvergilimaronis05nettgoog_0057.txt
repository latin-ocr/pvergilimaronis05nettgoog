THE STORY OF AENEAS' WANDERINGS. li

² the other a Trajan origin. Thus the comedian Menander, followed

by Turpilius, said of the temple of Venus in Leucas that it was

χ founded by Phaon of Lesbos ; whereas Varro attributed it to Aeneas

(Servius on Aen. 3. 279). So it was with Baiae, which Postumius,
the author of a work de edveata Aeaeae, and Lutatius, in his manual
of emmena aeteae, said was founded by Boia the nurse of
Euximua a companion of Aeneas. An older account, according to
Varro, said that the name was not Boiae but Baiae, and the founder
of the city was Baius, a comrade of Ulysses who was buried there
(Servius on Aen. 9. 710).

Aeneas was once represented as the founder of Rome, his eompanions
were shown by the historiens and poets who succeeded Fabius Pietei·
to have been equally active in other places. Prochyta, according to

1 Naevius, took its name from a kinswoman of Aeneas (Servius on Aen.

9. 715). Capua, according to Caelius Antipater, was founded by a
Trojan Capys (Servius on Aen. 10. 145). A Trajan origin was assigned
to (lorithus (Serv. on Aen. 7. 209) and to Patavium. In the same

¹ way Caieta, as we have seen, was said to be the place were the Trojan

ships were burnt.
Thus under the pressure of a great national condiet the Romans

⁸ eaued in a spurious mythology to dignify their cause. 'l'owurds the

end of the first Punic war we have another instance of the same
tendeuey. The Acarnanians, in appealing to Rome for assistance
against the Aetolians, based their claim on the fact that they were

’ the only Greeks who had sent no contingent to the aid of their

eonntrymen in the Trojan war (Justin. 28. 1). In the same spirit
the Romans deprived the Corinthians of Leucas and Anactorium,

³ and made their towns over to Acarnania (Dionysius 1. 51). Soon

afterwards comes the Roman alliance with Attalus king of Pergamus,
and the transference of the Great Mother of Pessinus, the guardian
deity of Aeneas, to Rome (205 aa). The peace made with Philip
in the same year included the inhabitants of Ilium on the side of the
Romuus3 it may be notieed that Idvy (29. 12. 14) mentions Attalus
and the Ilienses side by side. Nine years afterwards Flamininus,
after proolaiming the freedom of Graece at the Isthmian gemes,
dedicated at Delphi some silver shields and a golden crown with the
inscriptions

Αἰνεάδας Τίτος ὔμμιν ιἠτέρτατον ὤπασα δῶρον, and

ὃν πόρεν Αἰνεαδᾶν ταγὸς μέγαςί
It is worth while also in this connexion to read the account given in
Livy (37. 37) of the interview between P. Scipio Africanus and the

inhabitants of Ilium during the war with Antiochus in 190 aa,
followed hythe cession to themoi Rhoeteum and Gergis in 188 ac,
