P. VERGILI MARONIS

AENEIDos

mnus snoorvnus.

{u the first hali of the Aeneid it would almum seem ae if Virgil had intentionally
relieved those portioris of his narrative which possess the most absorbing interest with
others of e more level end less exeiting kind. The detailed aeonum of the agonias of
the one night of Troy's oapture was suooeeded bye repid sketeh of the events of seven
years of trevel; and nov ive'pess from the speetaole of Dido's frentie love and(ss a ·
modern reader will regerd it) Aeneas’ faithlossuess to e desoription ol the gemes eele-
brated by the Trojsn hero in Sicily ou the anniversary of his father’s death. This
serves to eonduet us from the tregedy of the Fourth Book to the mysterious solemni·
ties of the Sixth. Aeneas does not pesa at ouoe from the terrible oondiet of love and
duty to the initiation which is reserved for the ohoseu favourites of Hoeven, but is
shown to us the pious aud benedoent priuoe, reverantially dutiful to his fathers
memory, aud kind and liberel to his iollovers eud friends-enooureging the ambition
of his οπο men and returning the oourtesies ef the Sieilinns by a display in vhieh it
is his honour to be the dispenset of honour to others.

Aa usual, the subjeet and muoh of the treatment in detail are from Homer. The
heroio oourtesy oi Achilles is never more oonspiouous than inthe gemes which he
gives in memoryof his dead friend, as desoribed in the Tveuty·third llied: and by
¹ treeding in the steps of Homer, Virgil has sueoeeded in iuvesting his own hero vith

similar assentatione of ohivalrous magnifloenoe. For the soene in vhioh the aetion
is laid, he vas indebted to that variety of the Trojan legend vvhioh mede Anchises
die in Sicily, end to the tradition whioh had flxed a Trojsn oolony there already.
ThatAeuass should revisit the island by ohoioe or eooideutelly, aud that being there
he should‘ honour his father by a splendid funeral celebration, was s suffleiently
plausible development of the story. The earlier gemes, it is true, are little more
than's restrangement of the Homeris meteriels; but they are made interesting iu
themselves, aud the few novelties introduoed increase the reeder’s pleasnre-suoh aa
the adeotion between Nisus aud Euryalus, the defeat of the breggsrt hythe veteres
in the herting-mamb, end the portent of Aoestes’ arrow. The tilt, whieh vas
Aeneas' surprise for his speetators‚ is l'irgil's surprise for his reeders; it is desoribed
with au ingenious felicity of languege whioh exeroises oommentators and translatore
alike; and it must heve been peouliarly fletteriug to Augirstus to flod en exhibition
in vhioh he took pleasure referred tobis grem progenitor. virgil never seems to be
more in his element than when he is speaking of the youhg; end the halo of hope
vhioh surrounds the sons oi the oonquerors of ltsly is one of tha most plsesiug
features in the Aeneid
