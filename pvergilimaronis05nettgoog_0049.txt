which would sufficiently account for Virgil’s imitation if the fragment
ot the Annals had never been preserved by Macrobius] while it leaves
us no means of judging how Ennius would have treated such a situa-
tion if he had not had Homer to draw hom. The account of Romulus
aad Renum waiting for the augury, preserved by Cicero in the first
book oi his Dc Divinatione‚is not a very remarkable specimen of
narrative power. Homer would have introduced more details; Virgil
would have treated those which Ennius gives iu a moro artificial way,
dwelling on one or two, aad hinting the rest3 both would probably
have thrown in some short speech, directly or indirectly expressed, to
show the feeling of the rival brothers and the attendant multitude.
But without venturiag far-ther oa the precarious ground of hypothetical
criticism, we need scarcely doubt that there was nothing in Ennias’
conception of his art which Virgil was likely to welcome as a help
towards improviag upon Homer. Living in a prehistoric time, Homer ’
(Ι use the name for convenience' sake, not as taking a side ia the con-
troversy about his personality) is the only poet who has attaiued the
grace and finish ot a literary period; he is the only primeval poet so

’ complete in himself that it might be questioned whether it would have

been aa advantage to him to have lived later. rPhere may conceivably

’ bc ona or two touches in Ennius which appear to show a more modern

feeling than Homer’s, a heca sense of colour,⁸ aa appreciatioa oi
philosophy ⁹ aad literature as such; for an age, even when relatively
less advanced than some former age, is yet in a certain sense the heir
of all that have gone before it, and the age of Ennius in particular
possessed the rudimenta of criticism aad aspired after culture3 but,
regarded in the grass, Homer is mature and articulate, while Ennius
is still crude and infantiae, and it was not to be expected that the
large atterance of the divine foretime of Grecce should come meuded
to Virgil's ear when repeated by the stammering lips of his Italian
aucestors. Virgil may have believed, as Ennius did, that the saul
which dwelt in his own breast had once animated Homer3 bnt he
probably would not have recognized Enniusasthc intermediate channel
of its transmission.

It is needless to say anythiag of the rest of the earlier Roman epic
writers, who are indeed mere aarum to us; to speculata on the extent
to which Virgil's impressions of Apollonias' poem have been modified
by the version of Varro Atacinus, cf which live naimportant frng-
