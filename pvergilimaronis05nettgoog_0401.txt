’ The barning ol the ships hythe Trajan women was a part oi the Trojan legend,
though the story was very variously told, as will be seen by any one who will oonsult
Heyne’e Bueursus on the subjeot some placing the soene in Greeoe, some in Italy,
while one aooount connected it with the foundation ol Rome. Dionysiae agrees with
Virgilin making it an incident in the voyage ot Aeneas. In the aooount ot the late
ot Palinurus, withwhioh the book oloses, the poet, ae usual, haseombined an Italian
tradition withan imitation ol Homer. The promontory ol Palinurus was supposed
to have derived its name from the pilot ol Aeneas, who was bnried there: in the
Odyssey, Menelaus’ pilot dies et his post in the middle of his voyage: Ulysses loses
one ot his oomrades just as he is about to visit the shadea. virgil has fitted these
stagmente into his tesselated work, and has thus, es Heyne remarks, seoured an·
ephode ιο give interest ιο the voyage from Sieilytq Italy, whioh would otherwise
have been unaventtul.

It is no impeaobment oi the eptness end relevanoy ol this Book thet it probably
did not torm part ot Virgil¹s original eonoeption Ouarada, whose views about the
oomposition of the Aeneid have been mentioned in the Introductionto Book 3, has
pointed out, what had occurred more or less distinetly to others, that the words
‘Libyae oursu‚' Book 6. 338, naturally mean that Palinurus was lost during the
voyage from Carthago to Italy, whieh aoeordingly he supposes ιο have formed part
ol the story aa Virgil first planued it. There are ,other points in the soene with.
Palinurus in Book 6, whieh it requires some ingenuity to reoonoile with the narrative
at the end os this Book: the mentiones Apollo’s prediotiou (6. 313 loll), the stress
laid ou the stormy eondition ot the sea (vv. 354 foll), end perhaps the time dpring
whioh Palinurus represents himself ae kept alive atter bia fall (ib.) Agiria, the
request ol Anohises that Aeneae would oonsult the Sibyl mentioued in Book 6. 115,
would seem rather to have been an injunotiou giren in lile than identioal with thnt
whieh we read of vv. 731 toll. ol thia Book. Laedy, the supposition that this Book
was an atterthought, would aoeount at onoe for tha doubt whioh existed in anoient
times, whether the two first lines ot Book6 do not really belong ιο the present Book.
Had ‘virgil lived to eomplete bis work, he would doubtless have obserred these
diserepsnoles: as it is, they ooueem the eritioal scholar rather than the general
reader. The introductiones Nisus and Euryalus tn Book 9, aa if they had not
appeared in the narration before, may perhaps show thet the present Book was
oomposed later than Book 9.
