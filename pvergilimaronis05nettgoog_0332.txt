258 Ρ. VERGILI MARONIS

N une eadem labente die convivia quaerit,

Iliacosque iterum demens audire labores

Exposcit, pendetque iterum narrentis ab ore.

Post, ubi digressi, lumenque obscura vicissim eo
Luna premit suadentque cadentia sidera somnos,

Sola domo maeret vacua, stratisque relictis

Incubet: illum absens absentem auditque videtque:
Aut gremio Ascanium, genitoris imagine capta,
Detinet, inlendum si fallere possit amorem. . eo
