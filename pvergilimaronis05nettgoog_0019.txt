SEOOND AND THIRD ΕΒΙΤΙΟΝ S. xi

hitherto escaped the fate 01 Sophocles, whose peculiarities 01
expression, so curiously analogous to his, have too often been
changed by critical licence, the guinis his and that of Latin
literature. Whether it would he desirable that our knowledge
01 MS. materiale should be still farther extended by an equally
accurate collatiou of the cursives not examined by Ribbeck, I do
uotpresume to say. There can be no doubt that an apparatus
criticus like Ribbeck’s is far preferable 10 000 like Heyne and
Wagner's: as little doubt 000 there be that 10 collate the remain-
ing copies satisfactorily would be an almost endless taek. In the
Bodleian Library 01 Oxfordl alone there are about twenty MSS. 01
Virgil, hardly any 01 which seem 10 have been collated (1 except
of course the Canonician MS. which 1111. Butler has examiued so1
thomughly); the Collega Libraries too contain a few, the read·
iuga of one of which, a copy in Balliol Collega Library, No. 140,
referred by Mr. Ooxe to the fifteenth century, have been noted
vith scrupulous careby my friend Mr. B. Palmer, and placed at
my disposal. I myself examined ten or eleven of the Bodleian
MSS. 10 discover the authority for the readings ‘litus harenosum
libyae' in Aeneid 4. 257 (see Note on 4. 257 01 the end 01 the
10111111 Book) and ‘Trinacriis’ in Aeneid 5. 573 (see Note there),
doubts having arisen about the existence 01 each ; but almost
the only other passages I turned to were Aeneid 1. 668, where
tll agreed with the Medicean in giving ‘iniquae’ and the 0010·
brated lines about Helen in the Second Book, which they were
unanimous in omitting in the text, one 01 them adding the
1111110ςο in the margin. On the whole it would seem that while
it may be advisable to apply 10 an inferior MS. in a case like
that which I have mentioned, to ascertain a reading not otherwise
certified, it would be waste 01 time to perform partially 0 work
1111011, 10 have any value, should be performed entirely. It is
one thing 10 find that a particular reading which seems necessary
