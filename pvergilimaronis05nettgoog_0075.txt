'rur subjeot of the Aeneid, as propounded in the opening lines, is the settlement oi
Aeneas in Italy, after years of wandering, end a short but sharp final struggle. It is
however only of the events preceding the settlement that the poet really treats-of
the wanderings and the war. In thetae in other things, he follows Homer, who
does not show us Ulysses ‘⁴ an idle king, matehed with an aged wile, meting laws to
asawage raoe,’' but leaves him fresh from the slaughter oi the suitors, from the first
ambraoe of his wife and father, and from ffie oonquest of his disati‘ooted subjecta.
Aooordingly, the poem divides itself into tuo parte, the wanderings being embraced
hythe first, the Italian war by the seooud. But the two parts naturally involve
different modes of treatment, eomprehendIng as they do periodo of time widely
differiug in length, the one seven years, the other apparently a few days. Here
again the example of Homer is followed. The long period of wanderinga is taken at
apoiut not far from its oonelnsion; enough is told in detail to serve as a specimen
of the whole, and the rest is related moro summarily by the help of an obvious expe·
dieat, the hero being made to narrate his past adventures to the person whose rela-
tion to him is all the time forming one adventure moro. This peculiarity ol the
Homeris story is notiosd by Horaoe in a well-known pasmge of his Art of Poetry
(ww. 146 foll), and recommended to the adoption of Epio writers generally; but he
does not slearly indioate the reason of it, which doubtless is the wish to avoid that
fatal dryness whioh seems to be inseparable from all narratires where the events ot
many years are told eontinuously in a short oompnss. [See roh Ι. p. xxxv. foll.

Tho First Book of the Aeneid may be said to perform well the objeots whieh it
was no doubt intended to aeoomplish‚-thosa oi interesting us in the hero and intro·
duoing the story. After a brief statement of the subjeot, we have a view of the
supernatural maehinery by whioh it is to be worked out: and this, though imitated
from Homer, where the solitary raneonr of Poseidon against Ulysses answers to the
solitary ranoour of Juno against Aeneas, is skilfnlly oontriwed so aa to throw slight
on the subsequent history of the Roman deseendants of Aeneas, by the mention,
suen at that early time, of their great enemy, Carthago. It is probable‚ as Ι haue
said in the genero Introduction to the Aeneid, that the merit of this thought
may bo dne to Naevius, who aeems to haus been the first to oommit the felioitous
anachronism of bringing Aeneas and Dido together: but it must be allowed to be in
striut aooordanoe with the spirit of Virgil’s poem, whioh is throughout thot of
historioal anticipation. Like Ulysses, Aeneas is shipwreoked in the voyage which
was to have been his last, the main differenee being that the Greoian hero is

solitary, having long n’uoe lost all hie eompanions, while the Trojan is still aooom-
