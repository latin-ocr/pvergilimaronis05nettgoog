natural compulsion under which he goes. But fora hero to leave a
mortal love was no novelty in the heroic ege, as the titles 01 Ovid's
Heroic Epistlea sufficiently show. The novelty is in the interest which
Virgil has excited in the situation and feeliugs 011110 forsaken heroine.
He has struck the chord 01 modern passion, aud power-fully has it
respouded3 more power-fully, perhaps, than the minstrel himself ex-
pected. Had Homer written 01 Dido, we' should probably have been
called on to sympathize with her hut little3 ,our feeliugs would have
been with the hero whom she strove to keep 110111 the home whither·
he was bound. 'l'here were reasons which might have induced Virgil
to give a similar colour to his narrative. -All his sympathies are
Roman3 aud the breach between Dido and Aeneasis the symbol and
tha prophecy 01 the quarrel 01 Carthage and Rome. It is hard, too,

10 suppose that in sketching the Carthaginien queen, who endeavours

to keep Aeneas 1101111110 kingdom, he did not think again and again 01
the Egyptian enchantress to whom Antony would have 110001011011 the

sceptra 01 the western world, whose blandishments had prevailed over
the great Julius, and had been successfully resisted by Octavianus

alone. Circe might have supplied the legondary framework Cleopatra

the animating historical spirit3 and even though the Trojan Ulysses

had yielded to the alluremeuts 01 the charmer, we might have hailed

the flash 01 his drawn sword, and sent our hearts along with him in

his journcy from the euchanted shore. But Virgil 1100 not chosen to

paint a picture like this. Followiug in the track 01 Apollonius, he has

lavished all 1110 arton the presentation 01 0 vivid pertrait 01 female

passion. Dido’s flame has been kindled‚ not from within, hut from

without, bya supernatural power; the generosity 01 her nature has

already shown 110011 in the prinoely hospitality which she extends

to Aeneas and his shipwrecked eomrades3 but, after all, we sympathize

with her simply as a woman; it 10 the mere exhibition 01 the depths

01 0 woman’s heart that stirs our own so powerfully. Other heroes

have loved and left as Aeneas does3 few have had as strong 0 justi.

fication as he can plead 101 his ssight: bnt no oue seems to us so

traitorous as Aeneas, except it he Jasou3 and the reason lies in the

depth 01 colouring with which Virgil, like Euripides, has painted the

agouies 01 the abandoned queen.

The relation 01 Virgil to Homer, as l have said already, unquestion.
ably furnishes tha most important point 01 view from which the
Aeneid can bs regarded by one who wishes to estimato the surrounding
circumstances which told upon the genius 01 the Augustas poet. The
expectation 01 an unknown birth which should be greater than the
Iliad was doubtless the vision which illuminated the later years 01
