Theocritus, or the primitive simplicity 01 Hesiod. He appropriatos
their form boldly and openly, and does not ask himself whether he
has reproduced their spirit. 'I'o be the Roman Homer; to write the
sequel 01 thetole 01 Troy, 101 00 01 inferior, but as an equal, not as
ayounger 001 01 the victorious race, but aa the heir 01 those many
ages which had lifted the conquered people to 0 height 101· above their
conquemrs; 10 combine the glories 01 the heroic age with the august
antiquities 0111100111 nation; this was an ideal which might well
captivate a mind like Virgil's, aud which less partial voices than those

'I'he ehasm which separatos the Aeneid 11011 the Iliad and Odyssey is
undoubtedly one which is not easily spanned. 11101110 that sufficient
account has not always been taken 01 the numerous intervening objecta
which break the distance and afford resting-places to the eye. The
substance 01 the Homeric poet1y,the conduct 01 the action and the
conception 01 the actore, came 10 Virgil modified by the intermediate
agency 01 the Greek drama. His view 01 the 10111 may have been
similarly affected by the example 01 those later Greek epics 01 which
the poem 01 Apollonius is the only surviving specimen, and by the pre·

was no undistinguished member. But 1110 uusurpassed eminence 01

pariscn or contrast3 and the parallel ie itself one which Virgil, iar
110111 avoiding, has done his utmost to challenge. To a modern reader
the exactness 01 111000101101 only serves to make the 00111001ᾶο0001
and more unmistakable. Mr. Gladstone says nothing which a critic,
not swern, like himself, absolutely 10 the service 01 Homer, need hesi-
tate to admit, when he cafls attention 10 the extraordinary amount 01
admitted imitation and obvious similarity on the suriace 01 the Aeneid,
and pronounces nevertheless that the poem stands in almost every
fundamental particular in the etrongest 00111001 10 the Iliad.1 Both
features, the identity and the diversity, are, as I have just said,
sufficiently familiar to us; we have seen them in Virgil’s treatment
01 Theocritus and Hesiod and we shall not be surprised to meet them
again in his treatment 01 Homer. On the identity, indeed, there ie
