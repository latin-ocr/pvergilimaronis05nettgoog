Hie viridem Aeneas frondenti ex iliee metam

Constituit signum 11011110 pater, unde reverti lso
Seirent et longos ubi circumflectere eureus.

Turn loos sorte legunt, ipsique in puppibus auro
Ductores longe effulgent ostroque deeori;

· Cetera populea velatur fronde iuventus, ,
Nudatosque umeros oleo perfusa nitescit. 100
Considunt transtris, intenteque breoehia remis;

Intenti exspectant signum, exultantieque haurit

Corda pavor pulsans laudumque arrecta cupido.

Inde, ubi 01010 dedit sonitum tuba, finibus omnes,

Haut mora, prosiluere suis; ferit aethera elamor 140 ,
