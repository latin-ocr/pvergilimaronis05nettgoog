xlvi THE STORY 01⁴⁷ AENEAS’ WANDERINGS.

-aud yet further west the town Aeneia iu Chalcidice. Scuth-west
of Thessaly wc meet with the Αἰνιᾶνες, or as Pliny (t. 6) calls them,
the Aenienses; on the coast of Illyricum was a town called Aenona,
reminding us in the terminationes its name of Salona, Nerona‚Ve1ena,
Cremoua3 Pliny (5. 137) mentions au island Aenare in the neighbour-
hood oi Ephesus, and a kindred name to this appears iu that of the
well-known island Aenaria off the coast of Campania. It would

' perhaps be raah to mention the ancient name of the river Inn, Aenus,

in this connexion.

It is natural and easy to connect the patronymic Αἰνείας with these
names: but this connexion only makes darkness visible. The mean-
ing of the base Αἰνο· it is for Greek etymologists to decipher3 but
before leaving it it is necessary to notice the adjective Αἰνειάς, genitive
Αἰνειάδος, a title of Aphrodite. Temples to this Ἀφροδίτη Αἰνειάς are
mentioned as existing in his own time by Dionysius oi Halicarnassus
(1. 49) in Leucas, at Actium near another to the θεοὶ μεγάλοι, at
Ambracia, aud (ib. 53) at Elymus in Sicily. That the ancients should
have connected these temples with a supposed presence ot Aeneas aud
his mother in these places was natural enough: but it must surely be
remarked by a medem observor that Ἀφροδίτη Αἰνειιίς, cannot mean
Aphrodite the hecther es Aeneas, but must signify either Aphrodite the
deuphter ej Aeneas on the analogy ci Βαρειίς the daughter of Βορέας,
or (which Ι think more likely) Aphrodite of Aeneia or Aerarium, just as
Σιγειάς (Straba 13. l) means ef Sigeum. Klausen iu his Aeneas end
die Penatea, and Preller in his handbooks oi mythology, have not, so
far as Ι have seen, noticed this point; but, small as it may appear, it
has, I think, an important bearing on the subject before us. For if
Αἰνειάς as a title of Aphrodite is a mere local epithet, or at any rate a
title associated with the goddess in some way not at present ascertain-
able, the connexion of this Aphrodite with the hero of the Aeneid
will appear to have arisen from a misiuterpretatiou of names, and the
words Αἰνείας and Αἰνειάς to have nc more in common than their
kinship with the words Aenus or Aeneia.

Ido not think that the attempts of Klausen and cf Fick in his
Persorterrncmerr to connect Αἰνειάς with αἰνεῖν, to eomplp, or to comest,

can be regarded as successful. The title of precinas, cousentinp, οοοι-
ptyirtp, placabilis, might, no doubt, be well applied to Aphrodite, but

more evidence should be forthcoming before the question can be taken ⁴

ae settled, especially iu the case oi a proper name the antiqnity of
which may, for all that wc know, have removed it altogether out oi
the reach oi modern iuquiry.

rPhe connexion between Αἰνείας and Ἀφροδίτη Αἰνειάς appears then
to be only collateral, not derivative. And, if Αἰνείας is inform a local
