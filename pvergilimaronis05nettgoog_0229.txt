AENEID. LIB. ΙΙ. 155

Ipse Pater Danais animos viresque secundas
Sufficit, ipse deos in Dardana suscitat arma
Eripe, nate, fugam, finemque inpone labori.
Nusquam abero, et tutum patrio te limine sistam. ouo
Dixerat, et spissis noctis se condidit umbrie
Appareut dirae iacies inimicaque Troiae
Numina magna deum.
Tum vero omne mihi visum considere in ignis
Ilium etex imo verti Neptunia Troia; cuc
Ac veluti summis antiquam in montibus ornum
Onm ferro accisam crebrisque bipennibus instant
Eruere agricolae certatim ; illa usque minatur
