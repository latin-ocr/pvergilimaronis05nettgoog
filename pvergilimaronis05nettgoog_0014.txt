vi PREFAOE ΤΟ THE FOURTH EDITION.

composition of the Aeneid. At the end of the commentary on
the second Aeneid Ihave inserted a short excursus on the question
of Virgil's alleged debt to Pisander.

I have carefully read the commentarios of Servius aud Tiberius
Donatus and the Verona Scholia¹ and added from them and
from other sources a considerable number ol new notes to
Coningtcn‘s commentary. I have occasionally obtained some new
light from glossaries. The abbreviatione Glosa. nahe and Gloss.
Amploe. denote respectively the glossas collected by Labbe, and
published after his death by Ducange‚ as printed in Valpy’s
Stephanus: and the glossaries in the Amplonian library at Erfurt‚
edited by Oehler in the Neue Jahrbdelter Suppl, Band 13 (1847).

Thilo has conferred a great boon upon scholare hythe publication
of the first instalments of his new edition of Servius, which will, I
hope, be speedily completed. Of this work I have spoken at
length in the twentieth number of the Journal of Philology.

I have consulted Dr. Henry's Aeacideel throughout, with the

greatest pleasure and profit.
