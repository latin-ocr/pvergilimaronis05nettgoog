xxxiv AENEIS.

but it is good enough for the purpos03 it gives a verbal sanction
to a course which our hearts tell us to be the true one, und we
are satisfied with it accordingly. Aeneas is called the Phrygiau
freebooter, who comesto drive peaceful inhabitants from their homes,
and break the plighted engagements of a royal house ; and we sym·
pothino with topics so well adapted to conciliate modern readers.
Homer would not have allowed us to feel so; he would have given no
space to the pleadings of the nativos for their rights, but would have
thrown his whole strength on the case of the invaders, as being per·
fectly conformable to the-code of the heroic age. Virgil must have
sympathized with Aeneas, not only as realizing the adopted type of
heroic action, but as representing tho undeviatiug and relentless
march of Roman greatness. But the modern spirit was too strong
for him3 in describing Turnus as he conceived him to have been, he
was led, in fact, to advocate his cause, and to record a protest against
heroic aud Roman aggression ulike. It is the spirit of the drama
allowing itself free play; and the result is the enlargement of human
sympathy, the vindication of the weaker as well as of the stronger.
In many respecta, as I have intimated, the characteres Turnus does
not command our approva13 thereis fierceness in it, and blind fury,
and, in the case of Pallas at least, savage cruelty. But this barbarity
is the outgrowth of weakness 3 it is the impetent beating of a captive
against the iron bars of destiny; and as an exhibitiou of weakness we
sympathize even with it. So it is weakness, rendered hopeless and
helpless, that engages our interest iu the closing scene. It is
modelled, no doubt, on the fall of Patroclus, who is paralyzed and
’ disarmed by Apollo before he is killed by Hector, but the incidente
which, as we read them in Homer, touch us as we are touched hya
Α felcy tale, are wrought up by Virgil to a terrible moral significance.
The futes of the combatants have been balanced by Jupiter, and we
know that iu a short. time the only obstacle that keeps Aeneas from
his destined empire will be removed hy Turnus’s death. Yet that
brief space only serves to intensify our interest for the doomed man 3
our wishes lend him wings as he is flying for his life, and calling by
name on each of his terrified comrades; and we echo the agonized
prayer in which he implores the gods of his native laud to hold fast
Aeneas’s spear. The strife of the Olympian deities is over, Juno‘
herself has abandoned Turnus, and is reconciled to the prospect of
a Trojan empire without the name of Troy3 but we refuse to look so

far into the future. We follow Turnus through the few remaining
stages of helpless affort, dreamy bewilderment‚ and final overthrow,
feeling that till heis dead we cau spara no thoughts for the conqueror
and the fruita of his victory. All this, Ι repeat, is simply the tribute
