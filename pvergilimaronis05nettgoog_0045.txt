power of enchantments more mighty than her own. Accordingly,
when aha retiree to her chamber we have her thoughts and also her
dreams3 the last not simply mentioned, like Dido’s on the night aiter

1111011111 as she, though from a different oause; and even an arrange·
ment which gives her hope of binding J ason to herself does not preveni

, her from passing the dreary midnight hoors in an agony of hopeless

longing, which she is at one time nearly ending by swallowing a drng

ἵ from herowncasketoipoisons. Yet, though thereispower end beauty

here, it isnot the power and beauty of Virgil. Even the passage in
which Medea, with the casket lying open ou her lap, is struck with 1
sudden horror of death, and feels as she never felt before, that “ the
light is swaet, and itis a pleasant thing to behold the sun‚” deep as is
its truth and pathos, does not affert ns as wa expect to be affected by
an incident in an epia poem. Itis too modernior Homer; Virgil
might have owned the feeling, but he would have been content to
indicate it in two or three lines. The conference of Here and Pallas,
and their joint visit to Aphrodite, are evidently imitated from Here's
visit to Aphrodite in the Fourteenth Book of the Iliad, and are as

' evidently Virgil's model in the scene between Venus and cupid at .

the end of the rint Aeneid, and that between J nno end Venus attho
beginning of the Fourth3 but they do not impress the reader as he is
impressed by their Greek original, or by their Latin copy3 they are
graeeinh taurisci, ⁸in a word Ovidian3 but they are not apic. The
description oi hove overreaching Ganymede at dice, the boygod ercet
and radiant, his playmate ponting and pettish,is obviously made for
pointing3 bnt the picture would not find a place in a heroic gallery.
Nor is Apollonius writing in the ‘grand style’ when he introduces
Aphrodite playiully pinching herson’s cheek‚ and bribing him 10 attack
Medea by a promise of the magio bell with which Zeus played when 1
bebe in his cavam-nursery of Ida. The interview between Jason and
Medea ‚in the temple of Hecateia tendor and tonching3 but Virgil
would never have descended to the prettiness of the comparison oi
the two lovers, beshinl and silent, to 1111 pino-trees at first standing
still in the calm, aod then breaking into a rustle undar the agitatior
oi the wind: a smila which Valerius Flaccus has to tone down and
render less graphio in order to adopt it to the genius ot his quasi-
Virgilian imitation.⁸ When the voyage recommences, the poem again
cesses to interest us. The treacherous murder oi Absyrtus is narrated
