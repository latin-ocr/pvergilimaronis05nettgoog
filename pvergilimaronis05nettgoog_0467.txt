AENEID. LIB. V.

Hic primum Fortuna fidem mutata novavit.
Dum variis tumulo referunt sollemnia ludis, too
Irim de caelo misit Saturnia Iuno
Iliacam ad classem, ventosque adspirat eunti,
Multa movens, necdum anticum saturata dolorem.
Illa, riam celerans per mille coloribus arcum,
Nulli risa cito decurrit tramite virgo. 610
Conspicit ingentem concursum, et litora lustrat,
Desertosque videt portus classemque relictam.
