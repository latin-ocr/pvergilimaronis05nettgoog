Ut me conspexit venientem et Troia circum

Arma amens vidit, magnis exterrita monstris

Deriguit visu in medio, oalor ossa reliquit3

Labitur, et longo vix tandem tempore fatur:

Verane te facies, verus mihi nuntius adfers, sio
Nate dea? vivisne? aut, si lux alma recessit,

Hector ubi est? dixit, lacrimasque offudit et omnem
Implevit clamore locum. Vix pauca furenti

Vivo equidem, vitamque extrema per omnia duco ; elo
N e dubita, nam vera vides.

Heu i quiete casus deiectam coniuge tanto

Excipit? aut quae digna satis fortuna revisit

Hectoris Andromachen? Pyrrhin conubia servas i
