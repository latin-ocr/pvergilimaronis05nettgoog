P. Verrem MARONIS

Accipiunt socios etque agmina conscia iungunt.

Tempus erat, quo prima quies mortalibus aegris
Incipit et dono divum gratissima serpit:
In somnis, eece, ante oculos maestissimus Hector ιιο
Visus edesse mihi, largosque effundere fletus,
Raptatus bigis, ιιι quondam, aterque cruento
Pulvere, perque pedes treiectus lora tumentia.
Ei mihi, qualis erati quantum mutatus ab illo
Hectore, qui redit exuvias indutus Achilli, ιιι
Vel Danaum Phrygios iaculatus puppibus ignisl
Squalentem barbam et concretos sanguine crinis
