xiv PREFAOE TO SEOOND AND THIRDAEDITIONS.

Ihave controverted Mn. Gladstone’s view oi the relation of the
Aeneid to the Homeric poems, as expressed in the third volume
of his ‘ Stadios? In my former volume I vas thought,I believe,
to have disparaged unduly Virgil's claim to originality: I may
now be considered to be taking the opposite side, in vindicating
his right to be criticized independently of Homer. Both views
ere,I believe, true, and therefore consistent: hut it is possible
of course so to maintain either as to appear unmindful of the
other.

My obligations to my former colleague, Mr. Goldwin Smith,
are unfortunately confined in the present volume almost wholly
to the notes on the First Book, which we originally composed
together in 1853: and even they have since been so completely
recast that it would be difficult now to point to any part of them

as specially due to him. I need not say that Ι have still had the
benefit of Mr. Long's assistance.

JOHN OONINGTON.
