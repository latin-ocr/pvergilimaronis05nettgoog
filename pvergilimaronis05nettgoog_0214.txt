140 Ρ. VERGILI MARONIS

Lubrica convolvit sublato pectore terga

Arduus ad solem, et linguis micat ore trisulcis. 475
Una ingens Periphas et equorum agitator Achillis,
Armiger Automedon, una omnis Scyria pubes
Succedunt tecto, et flammas ad culmina iactant.

Ipse inter primos correpta dura bipenni

Limina perrumpit, postisque a cardine vellit 480
Aeratos3 iamque excisa trabe firma cavavit

Robora, et ingentem lato dedit ore fenestram.

Apparet domus intus, et atria longa patescunt ;
