VIRGIL AND PISANDER.
(See pp. 85 foll)

[The words of Macrobius (Sat 5. 2. 4, 5) are as follows: “Dicturumne me
putatis ea quae vulgo note sunt, qnod Theocritum sibi iecit pastoralis operis auc-
torem, ruralis Hesiodum, et quod in ipsis Georgicis tempestatis serenitatisque sigua
de Arati Phaenomenis traxerit, vel quod eversionem Troiae cum Sinone suo et equo

poets oi the apic cycle. His date is uncertain, but the latest assigned by Suidas is
