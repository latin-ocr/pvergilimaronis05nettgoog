424 P. VERGILI MARONIS

the natura of those'whieh we have already enoountered in earlier parts of the poem.
Iu the opening of the book, while we admira the description el the temple of cumae
and the raviugs of the Sibyl, aud eonfem that Vlrgil has there taken full aud werthy
advantage of a supposed form of the supernatural which in Homer's time was only in
its infanoy, we must yet leel the awkwardness with wbioh the Honorio Elpenoris
introduced ilrst as Missum abore ground, then as Palinurus below, when e single
drowued friend would have been rediment both ιο delay Aeneas’ deseaut and to meet
hiru on the threshold of the shedes. So again it is not clear whether it is to rapidity
' and indirectuess of narrative or ιο oarelessness that we are to impote tho apparent
iaaonsisteuoy between the intimatione that these rivers, one of them ninefold, had to
be passed by any oa'e wishing to penetrate into the inferum world, aad tha choum-
stantial detail which would lead us to suppose that Aeneas only erossod one, and
that only ouoe. But tho inooasisteney af treatment beeonm mere serious es we
advenae farlher inte the book. The lower world, as was said just now, is dividet by ’
Virgil into a neutral region, a place of tererent, aad a plsee of happiness. Tho two
latter present no diffloulty: the eoneeption al the former is not so satisfactory. The

, , general notion seems to be that it is the reeeptaole of those who, not having lulhlled

their natural time of lile, manat be proaouneed good or bed. This is Addison’s
view,¹ and it appears to satisfy the requiremente of the passage os well us any that
ean be suggested: but it does not show tho poet to have formed a eomisteut eonoep
tion. indeed, Virgil himself may be said to point out to us an ineougruity in the
picture he has drawn, when he iatreduees the class of persons who have maaet .
death by nujust sentences. We aro ‚ready at once to ask whether it is not the busi-
nessei the tribunal ol the other world to rootify the inequalityof earthly judgments³
and lest the thoughtshould not oeeur to us, Virgil suggests it himself by telling us
that the esses of these misjadged sittl'erors are reheard below. The natural oon·
olusion would be that, after this reheariug, the spirits, now truly judged, ere sent to
Tartareis or Elysium: but ol this not a ward is said, sud we are left ιο suppose that
they romain in the dubious limbo where we ilrst llud them But the doubt, onoe
raised, extends further, aud we ask whether the infallible'Minos oould not prononnoe

on the real ehameter ol all who have been prematurely eut off. A further question ’

arises as ιο the nature of premature death. Tartarus, as afterwards described, eon·
. taius many who have died before their time by the visitation of heaven. Is it
intended that the Mourningd'ields should oonmin all who have srrtlered by human
wengeanee? Eriphyleis there; would l'irgil have ventured to introduce Clytaem-
nestra? Agein, what is to be said of the heroes, who oocupy the extreme part ol this
· neatrelregion? Itisnot expressly stated that they diedinwar: we merely hear of
them es ‘bello elari’ ‘Thapaie speetre ol Adrastus ' happens ιο be the spirit of the
only one of the Seven against Thebes who survived the expedition. But even if we
suppose that Virgll's general conception is that oi elain warriors, can we say thot he
is eonsistent with himself in placing elain warriars iu a eonditiou neither of tarment
nor af happiness? There are heroes in Elysium: there are those who sufferat
’ Ι wounds in battle for their country. But among the heroes in the neutral region
there are louud not only the assedente of Troy, but its defendam. Was theirs nota
patriotio cause? or are we ιο distinguish those who were merely wounded from those
· who were killed, and say thet the former earned Elysium by their subsequent
lives?

Suoh are some of the questions that may bo raised about the earlier part af this
Book« But they are es nothing to the grand diffleulty which the poet has chusan to
ereata by his philosophy of transmigration The doctrine is a sublime one, and well
