THE STORY OF AENEAS’ WANDERINGS. lxi

θέλοντος αὐτὴν γῆμαι, αὐτὴ μὲν ἀντέλεγεν, ὑπὸ δὲ τῶν πολιτῶν συναναγ-
καζομένη, σκηψαμένη] τελετὴν πρὸς ἀνάλυσιν ὅρκων ἐπιτελέσειν, πυρὰν
μεγίστην ἐγγὺς τοῦ οἶκον κατασκευάσασα καὶ ἅψασα, ἀπὸ τοῦ δώματος αὑτὴν
εἰς τὴν πυράν ἔρριψεν. The vow of constancy, the pyre and the swerd,
the excuse ior raising the pyre, are adopted by Virgil. It may again
be observed that Timaeue’ account is the ehorter, and also that it differs
from that of Trogus as to the manner of Elissa's death.

Aa for the fortunas of Aeneae after his lauding in Latium, there
were two main traditione, one of which represented Aeneas as
obtaining the hand oi Lavinia only after war with her father Latinus,
the other that there was no fighting with Latinus at all, but that war
muse after his death in consequence of the claime oi Turnus to the
hand of Lavinia.

'Phe first, which ie the basis of the version adopted and modifled by
virgil, is alluded to by Servius ou Aen. 4. 620, who quotes (lato as
his authority. A quarrel breaks out between Aeneas and Latinus
in consequence of plundering 011 the part ol Aeneas' campanians3 in
the battle which ensues Latinus is elain. So Servius ou Aen. 9. 745,
ei veritatem historiae requiris, primo praelio interemptae ert Latinus.
See also Serv. Aen. 1. 259. Livy 1. l gives a slightly different
account ε alii proelio uictum Latinum pacem cum Aenea, deinde adfini·
tatem innuisse tradunt. The other tradition is given by Livy in the

following terme: alii (tradunt) cum instructae acies conatitiseent, pri-
usquam siqua renuent, processisse Latinum inter primores, ducemque ad-
venarum moenere acl conloquium: percontatum deinde qni mortales errent,
unde aut qno earu profecti domo, quidue quaerentes in aprum Laurentem

οεοιὶιοανιέ, postquam audierit multitudinem Troianos ease, ducem Aeneam,
filium Anchisae et Veneris, cremata patria et ἀοοιο prosaque aedem aon-
dcndaeque urbi leoena quaerere, nobilitatem adnuiratum pentir virique, et
animum uel bello nel paci paratum, deutera clota fidem futurae amicitiae
concine. There is a general resemblance between this description and
Virgil's words in the seveuth Aeneid (229) ε Die cedem οαιόιιαιιι patriis
laresque roqamue Innocuam, et cunctis undamque annumque potetatem.
.. ‚Fata per Aeneae iuro electrumque potentantur fide, aea quie bello
est expertus et armis. It may be that virgil, though varying the tradition
for his own purposcs, ie working upon the same materiale as Livy.
The account given by Dionysius represents Latinus ae at war with
the Rutuli when Aeneas lauded. Latinus is forbidden by eracles to
light with the swanger, and advieed rather to ally himself with the
Ἕλληνες. Aeneas advunces his claime, and receives from Iiatinus an
assurance which recalls Dido’s Non iqnara mali mnerir succurrere
diaco The Trajan hero marries lavinia3 the Aborigines and Rutuli
receive the neme of Latini, but afterwards the Rutuli, under the
