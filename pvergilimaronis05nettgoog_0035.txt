l INTRODUOTION. xxix

l may be partly owing to onr misapprehension of the nse oi the epithet,
which was donbtless intended to be a Homerie one, attached ιο the
name as a sort oi prolix, and to be taken as a matter of conrse; bnt ,
his piety is not merely nominal: it shows itseli in his whole feeling
and conduct to the gods, his father, and his son. Heyne, who had a
sonl to admira and reverence both Homer and virgil, remarks on the
dignity and beanty oi Aeneas’s address to Evander. His faithfulness
to the memor-y oi Pallas is all the more noble, as apparently being not,

J like that of Achilles to his dead friend, gronnded on strong persona]

ἵ affection, bnt rather the offspring oi genereus seli-reproaoh for his own

i involuntary failnre to discharge a secred trust. His long forbearance

ζ towards husus, and the revulsion oi feeling when he sees him dead,

¹ contrasts shangely with the “genuine manliness ’² with which Turnus
exulta in the prospect oi killing Pallas, and glories over him when
killed But the greater the tenderness and grace oi these traits of
character, the harsher the jar with which we find the hero of the

ς Aeneid exhibiting at other times the savage, indomitable spirit oi the
hero of the Iliad. There is tenderness, deep tenderness, mingled with
the ferocity of Achilles: yet we are not surprised when, aiter receiv-

1 ing Priam graeionsly, and losing his own sorrows in sympathy with
the poor old lring, he is roneed ιο momentary inry by a word spoken
ont of sanson. B'nt the temperet Aeneas is less impulsive, and his
gentlaness more abiding and anhonbled, so that our feelings are
shoclred when we see him plnnging his hands in blood as deeply as a
Homer-ic warrior, and reserring the sons of two families ιο be saeri-
ficed alive on the funeral pile of hie friend. It is in keeping with the
manners of the heroic age; bnt it is not in keeping with the hnmanity
with which the poet’s modern spirit has led him ιο invest the rest of
the character. It is this inconsistency between the heroic and the
modern type which we leel in Aeneas’s treatment of Dido. Stripped
of ils accessories, the eondnet of Aeneas to Dido is not very nnliks

r thet oi Ulysses to Calyps0,ii not to Circe. He is thrown on her eoast;
heis treated hospitably3 he accepts the position of a husband; he
leaves her that he may go to his natural home. It can hardly be said
that the deity of Calypso constitutas an essentia] difference between
her and Dido. If she is a goddess, her words show that she ieels the
love and even the jealousy oi a woman3 and the criticism¹ which
contrasts Ulysses’s iarewell ιο her with the langnage of Aeneas to
Dido might perhaps have been spared, ii it had been recolleoted that in
Homer she herself receives the order from the gods to part with

. Ulysses, while in Virgil the whole burden is thrown upon Aeneas, who
has not only to justiiy himself ior going, bnt to ronch ior the snper-
