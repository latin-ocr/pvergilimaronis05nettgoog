liv THE STORY OF AENEAS' WANDERINGS.

certe coruitem eorum esse manifestum est, adeo ut et coruulm et praetores
seu dictatores cum adeunt magistratum Lauinii rem divinam faciaut
Penatibus pariter et Vestae.- see also Servius on Aen. 2. 296. 'Phe
names Laurentum aad Lauinium are probably connected in ety-
mology; thaumatum, which may be the same as that which
appears in lau-rus,being the semein both. The question may also
fairly be celred, as Preller has seen, whether the names Dauuus and
Daunia, familiar in connexion with Turnus, are not alrin to Lavinium
and Laurentum, exhibiting the common interchange of d and l. I dc
not venture to offer a decided opinion on the meaning of the mot tu·
or lau, which forms the basis of these words, aud also of Lavama and
Lauermum (Macrob. 3. 16. 4); whether it is the sameas that of luere
aud lustrum and contains the idea of purification, as Schwegler is
inclined to think, or whether it is not rather connected with taetus
and luxuries. The etymology oi the aucients, which connected
Laurentum with laurus, is not to be despised; compare Virgil’s name
Quercens from putemus, and Pomeutium (Strabo 5. 3) or Pometia (Pliu.
3. 68) from pomum. There was a place called Lauretum on the
Aventius, ubi silua laurete suit (Pliny 15. 138); Macrob. 3. 12. 3,
coastat quidem uuuo lauro sacm‘fieautes opud oram marimum cormsari ,·
sed multo post Romanu cauditum haec mualetudo sumpsit cumdium,
postquam iu Armtiuo Lauretum coepit virere, quam rem docet Varro
Humanarum libro secundo. Thalamus was to the Romans the symbol
oi peace aud prosperity, and was evidently from very early times

associated with Italian worship. We may rcmember Virgil's lines, ⁸.

Aen. 7. 591011, Laurus erat tecti aredio iu penetralibus altis, Sacra
, comam multosque utetu seruata per aanor, Quam pater iuuentam, primm
cum conderet arces, Ipse serebatur Phoebo sacrasse Latinus, Laurmtesque
ab eu uomeu posuisse colonis.

lavinium then, the home of the latin Penates, was the religione
capital oi the latin leugae. The symbol ot the league was a sow with
thirty young ones, signitying the thirty cities of the confederacy.
The story of the sow reminds ns of the horse’s head of Carthage,
the wolf ol Rome, the ox of Bovillae (Nonius s. v. hillo, and Schol.
Persius 6. 55) aud Buthrotum (Servius ou Aen. 3. 293). On Aen 4.
196 Servius relatas a similar table about Iarbas following a ram to the
settlement of Jupiter Hammon. Varro (R. R. ut. 18) tells us not
only that there were in his days at Iavinium bronze figures of the
sow and her young ones, but that the priests still shewed the actual
body of the mother pickled in brine. Now the Latin name for a sow
with young was Troia ‚⁸⁸ and there was, if we may trust Livy 1. l. 4,

⁸ Sea murus Freuuh Dictionury‚ s. v. aaa. The evidence ior the Latin word
is troia, or troya, derived from glossaries : but nistre does not, like Dies, deny its
existence.
